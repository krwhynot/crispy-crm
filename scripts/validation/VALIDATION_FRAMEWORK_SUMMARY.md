# Data Validation Framework - Task 1.3 Complete

## Overview
The Data Validation Framework for the CRM migration has been successfully implemented according to Task 1.3 requirements from the parallel plan.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Files

1. **`referential-integrity.js`** - Foreign key validation
   - Validates all foreign key relationships
   - Checks for orphaned records
   - Detects invalid array references (contact_ids in deals)
   - Generates fix recommendations with SQL snippets
   - Severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

2. **`unique-constraints.js`** - Conflict detection
   - Detects duplicate company names (case-insensitive)
   - Validates contact email/phone uniqueness within organizations
   - Checks opportunity name uniqueness within companies
   - Validates tag name uniqueness
   - Identifies fixable vs non-fixable conflicts

3. **`required-fields.js`** - Completeness check
   - Verifies all entities have required fields populated
   - Validates company sectors against allowed values
   - Checks contact name completeness
   - Validates deal/opportunity required fields
   - Ensures timestamps and metadata presence

4. **`data-quality.js`** - Source data assessment
   - Calculates completeness scores per entity
   - Assesses data accuracy metrics
   - Evaluates data consistency
   - Validates data validity
   - Generates weighted quality score (40% completeness, 30% accuracy, 20% consistency, 10% validity)

5. **`go-no-go.js`** - Automated decision logic
   - Integrates all validators
   - Enforces <1% data warning threshold (99% quality score required)
   - Evaluates critical blockers
   - Checks system readiness
   - Generates confidence score
   - Produces GO/WARNING/BLOCK recommendation

## Key Features Implemented

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ All foreign keys reference valid records
- ✅ Unique constraint conflicts detected for new schema
- ✅ Required fields verified (e.g., company must have valid sector)
- ✅ Data quality score calculation with <1% warning threshold
- ✅ Validation reports with severity levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### Report Generation
Each validator generates comprehensive reports including:
- Status (PASSED/WARNING/FAILED/BLOCKED)
- Detailed violation lists with samples
- Fix recommendations
- SQL snippets for remediation
- Confidence scores

### Business Rules Compliance
The validators enforce business rules from `migration-business-rules.md`:
- Companies have mutually exclusive primary roles
- Contacts can belong to multiple organizations
- Opportunities require products and customers
- Soft delete cascading rules
- Principal-distributor relationships

## Usage

### Individual Validators
```bash
# Run specific validators
node scripts/validation/referential-integrity.js
node scripts/validation/unique-constraints.js
node scripts/validation/required-fields.js
node scripts/validation/data-quality.js
```

### Complete Go/No-Go Decision
```bash
# Run complete validation suite with automated decision
node scripts/validation/go-no-go.js
```

### Environment Requirements
```bash
# Required environment variables
export VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
export VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Testing
A test script has been provided to verify framework integrity:
```bash
node scripts/validation/test-validation-framework.js
```

## Integration with Migration Pipeline

The validation framework integrates with the migration execution pipeline:
1. Pre-migration validation (dry-run mode)
2. Go/No-Go decision point
3. Migration execution (if approved)
4. Post-migration validation

## Decision Thresholds

### Critical Blockers (Migration Cannot Proceed)
- Any CRITICAL severity violations in referential integrity
- Any CRITICAL unique constraint conflicts
- Data quality score below 99% (>1% warnings)

### Warning Conditions (Migration Can Proceed with Caution)
- HIGH severity violations that are fixable
- MEDIUM severity issues with available remediation
- System checks passed but with advisories

### Success Criteria
- Zero critical violations
- Data quality score ≥99%
- All system readiness checks passed
- Confidence score ≥80%

## Next Steps
With the validation framework complete, the migration pipeline can now:
1. Run comprehensive pre-migration validation
2. Generate detailed validation reports
3. Make automated go/no-go decisions
4. Provide clear remediation paths for issues
5. Ensure data integrity throughout migration
