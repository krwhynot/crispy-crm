  - Orphaned records check (<1% threshold)
  - Foreign key integrity validation
  - Required fields assessment
  - Data quality checks
  - Disk space verification
  - Backup table creation
  - Go/No-Go decision logic

- ✅ `/scripts/validation/capture-current-state.sql` (600+ lines)
  - Comprehensive state capture
  - Record counts and totals
  - Relationship mappings
  - System metrics

### 2. JavaScript Runner
- ✅ `/scripts/validation/run-pre-validation.js` (394 lines)
  - Database connection management
  - SQL file execution
  - Results processing and display
  - JSON report generation
  - Go/No-Go assessment
  - Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 3. NPM Commands Added
- ✅ `npm run validate:pre-migration` - Run full validation
- ✅ `npm run validate:pre-migration:dry-run` - Dry run mode

## Validation Checks Implemented

### 1. Data Counts
- Total active deals, contacts, companies
- Deleted records tracking

### 2. Orphaned Records (Go/No-Go Criteria: <1%)
- Contacts without valid company
- Deals with invalid company references
- **FAIL** if >1%, **WARN** if >0.1%, **PASS** otherwise

### 3. Foreign Key Integrity
- Broken contact references in deals
- Broken company references in tags
- **FAIL** if any broken references found

### 4. Required Fields
- Companies without sector
- Deals without stage
- **FAIL** if critical fields missing

### 5. Data Quality
- Duplicate company names
- Invalid email formats
- **WARN** or **FAIL** based on severity

### 6. System Resources
- Database size calculation
- Required backup space (2x DB size)
- **WARN** for databases >50GB (manual verification needed)

### 7. Backup Creation
- `backup_deals_pre_migration`
- `backup_contacts_pre_migration`
- `backup_companies_pre_migration`
- All with timestamp metadata

## Go/No-Go Decision Logic

The system makes a final Go/No-Go decision based on:
- **GO** (PASS): 0 failures, ≤2 warnings
- **CAUTION** (WARN): 0 failures, 3-5 warnings
- **NO-GO** (FAIL): Any failures or >5 warnings

## Output & Reporting

### Console Output
- Color-coded results (✔ PASS, ⚠ WARN, ✖ FAIL)
- Grouped by check type
- Summary statistics
- Clear Go/No-Go decision

### JSON Report
- Saved to `/logs/pre-migration-validation.json`
- Includes all check results
- Validation and capture run IDs
- Timestamp and decision

## Usage Instructions

### Run Full Validation
```bash
npm run validate:pre-migration
```

### Run Dry Run (No DB Changes)
```bash
npm run validate:pre-migration:dry-run
```

### Environment Requirements
The script automatically detects database configuration from:
1. `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (direct connection)
2. `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (Supabase project)

## Integration with Migration Pipeline

This validation must be run before:
- Task 5.2: Migration execution
- Any production deployment

The script exits with:
- Exit code 0: Validation passed (GO or CAUTION)
- Exit code 1: Validation failed (NO-GO)

This allows CI/CD pipelines to automatically halt on validation failure.

## Compilation Status

✅ **TypeScript compilation successful**
- No errors in build process
- No diagnostics issues in validation files

## Next Steps

With Task 5.1a complete, the migration pipeline can proceed to:
1. Review validation results
2. Address any warnings or failures
3. Execute Task 5.2 (Migration execution) if validation passes

## Notes

- All validation queries are idempotent
- Backup tables are created with timestamps
- Results are stored in `migration_validation_results` table
- State capture stored in `migration_state_capture` table
- Both tables persist for audit trail and rollback verification
