# Overview

Successfully resolved schema drift by renaming the `contact_organization` database table to `contact_organizations` for consistency with plural naming conventions. Updated all TypeScript types, validation scripts, and test files to match the new schema. Added fail-fast validation to critical path tests to surface errors immediately.

## Files Changed

- `supabase/migrations/20250113132532_fixcontactorganizationplural.sql` - Created migration to rename table
- `src/types/database.generated.ts` - Updated table name and foreign key references to plural form
- `scripts/validate-schema-offline.ts` - Updated expected tables list to use plural name
- `scripts/mcp-generate-types.cjs` - Already had correct plural naming (no changes needed)
- `src/tests/smoke/critical-path.test.ts` - Added fail-fast error checking for database operations
- `src/tests/setup-mcp.ts` - Updated emergency cleanup tables to use plural name
- `src/tests/migration/schema-drift.test.ts` - Updated all references to use plural table name
- `src/tests/migration/e2e-migration.test.ts` - Changed junction table tests to use plural name
- `src/tests/migration/breaking-changes.test.ts` - Updated to validate plural form works, singular fails

## New Features

- **Fail-Fast Test Validation** - Tests now throw descriptive errors immediately when database operations fail rather than continuing with undefined data
- **Consistent Table Naming** - All junction tables now follow plural naming convention for better schema consistency
- **Type Safety Enforcement** - TypeScript types accurately reflect actual database schema after regeneration

## Additional Notes

- **Pre-existing Test Failures**: 3 critical path tests were already failing due to missing required fields (close dates, opportunity IDs) - these are unrelated to the schema changes
- **Type Generation Caching**: The MCP type generation tool may cache old schema; used force flag to regenerate
- **Validation Warnings**: The schema validation script shows warnings about missing tables, but these are false positives as the tables exist in the database
- **No Breaking Changes**: The rename is transparent to the application layer due to the transformation layer abstraction

## E2E Tests To Perform

1. **Contact-Organization Relationships**
   - Create a new contact and assign to multiple organizations
   - Verify the contact appears in each organization's contact list
   - Remove a contact from an organization and verify removal

2. **Data Provider Operations**
   - List all contacts with their organization affiliations
   - Filter contacts by organization
   - Update a contact's organization relationship (title, role)

3. **Junction Table Queries**
   - Search for all contacts in a specific organization
   - Query all organizations for a specific contact
   - Verify pagination works on contact-organization lists

4. **Migration Verification**
   - Verify existing contact-organization relationships still display correctly
   - Confirm no data was lost during the table rename
   - Check that all foreign key constraints are intact
