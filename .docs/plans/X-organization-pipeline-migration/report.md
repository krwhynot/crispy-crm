# Overview

Successfully migrated the Atomic CRM from "companies" to "organizations" terminology across the entire stack, including database schema, TypeScript types, and 65+ component files. Implemented a new 8-stage food service industry pipeline replacing the generic sales stages, with stage-specific fields and conditional rendering. The migration was executed through parallel task execution, completing 23 tasks with zero TypeScript compilation errors and a successful production build.

## Files Changed

### Database & Schema
- `supabase/migrations/20250126000000_organization_pipeline_migration.sql` - Created comprehensive migration renaming companies table, updating opportunity_stage enum, recreating 8 views
- `src/types/database.generated.ts` - Regenerated TypeScript types from new schema

### Core Components (17 files renamed and updated)
- `src/atomic-crm/organizations/` - Entire directory renamed from companies/, all 17 component files updated with organization terminology
- `src/atomic-crm/providers/commons/getOrganizationAvatar.ts` - Renamed from getCompanyAvatar, updated function names
- `src/atomic-crm/activity/ActivityLogOrganizationCreated.tsx` - Renamed from ActivityLogCompanyCreated, updated component and routes

### Opportunity Pipeline
- `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/stageConstants.ts` - New centralized constants file for 8-stage pipeline
- `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/OpportunityListContent.tsx` - Updated to use centralized stage constants
- `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/OpportunityColumn.tsx` - Removed hardcoded stages, uses constants
- `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/OpportunityInputs.tsx` - Added stage-specific fields with conditional rendering
- `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/OpportunityList.tsx` - Updated stage filters for new pipeline
- `src/atomic-crm/dashboard/OpportunitiesChart.tsx` - Updated stage multipliers for probability calculations

### Data & Validation
- `src/atomic-crm/validation/opportunities.ts` - Updated stage enum, added stage-specific field schemas
- `src/atomic-crm/validation/organizations.ts` - Removed backward compatibility aliases
- `src/atomic-crm/providers/supabase/unifiedDataProvider.ts` - Removed dual-naming support
- `src/atomic-crm/providers/supabase/resources.ts` - Updated resource mappings to organizations

### Configuration & Navigation
- `src/atomic-crm/root/CRM.tsx` - Updated resource registration to organizations
- `src/atomic-crm/root/ConfigurationContext.tsx` - Changed companySectors to organizationSectors
- `src/atomic-crm/layout/Header.tsx` - Updated navigation routes and labels
- `src/atomic-crm/consts.ts` - Changed COMPANY_CREATED to ORGANIZATION_CREATED

### Edge Functions & Scripts
- `supabase/functions/postmark/addNoteToContact.ts` - Updated queries to organizations table
- `scripts/seed-data.js` - Updated default stages and probability mappings
- `monitoring/alerts/opportunity-alerts.json` - Updated SQL queries for organizations

## New Features

### Organization Management
- **Organization Resource** - Complete replacement of companies with organizations across all CRUD operations
- **Organization Types** - Support for different organization types with parent-child relationships
- **Multi-Organization Contacts** - Contacts can belong to multiple organizations through junction table

### Food Service Pipeline
- **8-Stage Pipeline** - New stages: new_lead, initial_outreach, sample_visit_offered, awaiting_response, feedback_logged, demo_scheduled, closed_won, closed_lost
- **Stage-Specific Fields** - Conditional fields appear based on stage (sample info, feedback scores, demo details, closing data)
- **Centralized Stage Management** - Single source of truth for stages eliminating 4+ duplications
- **Smart Probability Calculation** - Automatic probability assignment based on stage with manual override capability

### Data Integrity
- **Database Migration Tracking** - Migration history table tracks all schema changes with row counts
- **Type-Safe Validation** - Zod schemas enforce data integrity at API boundaries
- **Backward Compatibility Views** - Database views provide temporary backward compatibility during transition

## Additional Notes

### Important Considerations
- **No Backward Compatibility in Code** - Following fail-fast principle, all code references updated without aliases
- **Database Fields Retained** - Fields like `company_id` and `company_name` remain for data compatibility
- **Activity Context Values** - Activity log still uses "company" as context value for historical data
- **ESLint Issues** - Pre-existing linting issues unrelated to migration (87 errors, 18 warnings)

### Migration Completeness
- **Zero TypeScript Errors** - All compilation errors resolved
- **Successful Production Build** - Application builds and bundles correctly
- **Database Applied** - Migration successfully applied to Supabase project
- **Types Regenerated** - Database types reflect new schema

## E2E Tests To Perform

### Organization CRUD Operations
1. **Create Organization** - Navigate to /organizations, click "Create", fill form with name/type/website, save, verify redirect to detail page
2. **List Organizations** - Navigate to /organizations, verify list displays with proper columns, test pagination and sorting
3. **Edit Organization** - Click edit on any organization, modify fields, save, verify changes persist
4. **Delete Organization** - Select organization, delete, confirm in modal, verify removal from list
5. **Parent Organization** - Create organization with parent, verify hierarchy displays correctly

### Opportunity Pipeline
1. **Create Opportunity** - Create new opportunity, verify default stage is "New Lead", save successfully
2. **Stage Progression** - Drag opportunity card between stages on kanban board, verify position saves
3. **Stage-Specific Fields** - Edit opportunity in "Sample/Visit Offered" stage, verify sample fields appear; change to "Demo Scheduled", verify demo fields appear
4. **Closed Won Fields** - Move opportunity to "Closed - Won", verify final amount and contract fields are required
5. **Closed Lost Reasons** - Move opportunity to "Closed - Lost", verify loss reason dropdown and competitor field appear

### Navigation & Routes
1. **Main Navigation** - Verify top navigation shows "Organizations" not "Companies"
2. **URL Routes** - Navigate to /organizations, verify URL and page load correctly
3. **Cross-Links** - From contact detail, click organization link, verify navigation to organization detail

### Data Relationships
1. **Contact Organizations** - Create contact, assign to organization, verify relationship displays
2. **Multi-Organization** - Add contact to multiple organizations, verify all relationships show
3. **Opportunity Organizations** - Create opportunity with customer/principal organizations, verify both display

### Dashboard Analytics
1. **Pipeline Chart** - Navigate to dashboard, verify opportunities chart shows 8 new stages
2. **Stage Colors** - Verify stage colors match specification (semantic colors, not hex values)
3. **Probability Calculation** - Create opportunities at different stages, verify weighted pipeline value calculates correctly
