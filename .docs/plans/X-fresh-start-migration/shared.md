# Fresh Start Migration: Shared Architecture Document

This migration creates a clean Atomic CRM database schema with correct "opportunities" naming from inception, removing all legacy "deals" code and backward compatibility layers. The approach leverages an empty database to avoid data transformation complexity while implementing proper Zod validation at API boundaries.

- UNIQUE constraints: SKU per principal, active contact-organization pairs
- EXCLUDE constraints: Prevent overlapping pricing tiers
- RLS policies: `FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND deleted_at IS NULL)`

## Architectural Patterns

### Database-Level Business Logic
**Critical Pattern**: Extensive business logic implemented via PostgreSQL functions and triggers
- Search vector maintenance automatic via triggers
- Opportunity probability auto-calculation based on stage
- Multi-principal validation and relationship management
- Activity consistency enforcement
- Complex product pricing and availability calculations
- **Why it matters**: Ensures data integrity at lowest level, prevents duplicate logic

### Validation Architecture
**Zod Schemas at API Boundaries**: All validation in `/src/atomic-crm/validation/`
- Single-point validation per Core Principle #3
- Schemas export both Zod definitions and React Admin validation functions
- Business rules: probability 0-100, semantic colors only, reminder dates before due dates
- JSONB field validation for flexible email/phone storage
- **Current State**: Zod already implemented for all core entities

### Product Catalog System
**Complete Product Management**: Comprehensive subsystem with pricing and inventory
- Multi-tiered pricing models (fixed, tiered, volume, subscription)
- Distributor authorization controls
- Inventory tracking with reorder points
- Seasonal availability management
- Product features and categorization hierarchy
- **Integration**: Products link to opportunities via `opportunity_products`

### Activity System (Engagements vs Interactions)
**Two-Type Activity Model**: Distinguishes customer touchpoints
- **Engagements**: Activities without opportunity context (prospecting, general outreach)
- **Interactions**: Activities linked to specific opportunities (demos, negotiations)
- Tracked via `activities` table with `activity_type` enum
- Functions `log_engagement()` and `log_interaction()` for proper recording

### Multi-Organization Contact Management
**Complex Relationship Model**: Contacts belong to multiple organizations
- `contact_organizations` junction with role, influence, decision authority
- `contact_preferred_principals` tracks principal preferences
- Primary organization syncing via triggers
- Functions for querying organizational relationships

### Full-Text Search Implementation
**PostgreSQL tsvector Pattern**: High-performance search
- `search_tsv` columns on searchable tables
- GIN indexes for fast full-text queries
- Automatic maintenance via `update_search_tsv()` triggers
- Weighted search across multiple fields

### Soft Delete Pattern
**Logical Deletion**: Use `deleted_at` timestamps
- All tables include `deleted_at` column
- RLS policies filter: `AND deleted_at IS NULL`
- `unarchiveOpportunity()` method for restoration
- Maintains referential integrity and audit trail

### Summary View Optimization
**Pre-computed Views**: Performance optimization for list operations
- `*_summary` views aggregate common queries
- Include relationship counts and metrics
- Materialized views for expensive calculations
- Used by React Admin list components

### Kanban Index Management
**Drag-Drop Reordering**: Complex positioning logic
- Index field for manual ordering within stages
- Gap-based indexing to minimize updates
- Implemented in `OpportunityListContent.tsx`

### Migration Numbering
**Timestamp Format**: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (e.g., `20250125000000_fresh_crm_schema.sql`)
- Ensures explicit ordering
- Prevents numbering conflicts
- Allows parallel development

### Resource Registration
**React Admin Pattern**: Lazy-loaded components
- Resources registered in `/src/atomic-crm/root/CRM.tsx`
- Minimal exports from feature modules
- Automatic route and navigation generation

### Data Provider Lifecycle
**Pre/Post Operation Hooks**: Transform and validate data
- Attachment handling in lifecycle callbacks
- File upload processing for avatars
- Transformation between API and UI formats

### Form Structure
**Admin Form Layer**: Consistent validation and error handling
- Components in `/src/components/admin/`
- Integrated with React Hook Form
- Zod validation at submission

### RLS Security
**Simple Authentication**: No complex multi-tenant logic
- Pattern: `FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND deleted_at IS NULL)`
- All authenticated users see all data
- Soft deletes enforced at RLS level

### Storage Integration
**Supabase Storage**: File attachment management
- Public bucket with RLS policies
- Processed via dataProvider lifecycle callbacks
- Automatic cleanup on record deletion
