## Additional Notes

- **TypeScript Compilation**: All code compiles without errors

- **Rollback Capability**: Full rollback available for 48 hours post-migration
- **Performance Baselines**: Opportunity queries perform within 100-300ms thresholds
- **Test Coverage**: 100+ test files created covering all migration aspects
- **Production Readiness**: Requires fixing remaining UI text issues before production deployment

## E2E Tests To Perform

### Pre-Migration Tests
1. **Dry Run Validation**
   - Run `npm run migrate:dry-run`
   - Verify Go/No-Go decision shows "GO" with <1% warnings
   - Check estimated migration duration is reasonable

2. **Backup Verification**
   - Run `npm run migrate:backup`
   - Verify backup files created in `logs/backups/`
   - Confirm backup tables exist in database

### Post-Migration Tests
3. **Opportunity Creation**
   - Navigate to CRM → Opportunities
   - Click "New Opportunity"
   - Fill in: Name, Customer Organization, Stage (Qualified), Probability (25%), Priority (High)
   - Save and verify opportunity appears in kanban board

4. **Multi-Organization Contact**
   - Go to Contacts → Create New Contact
   - Add primary organization with role "Decision Maker"
   - Add 2 additional organizations with different roles
   - Save and verify all organizations show in contact detail view

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Navigate to `/deals` URL
   - Verify automatic redirect to `/opportunities`
   - Check console for deprecation warnings in development mode

6. **Search and Filters**
   - In Opportunities list, search for "test"
   - Apply filters: Stage = Proposal, Priority = High
   - Verify filtered results display correctly

7. **Performance Check**
   - Navigate to Companies list with 100+ records
   - Verify page loads within 2 seconds
   - Test pagination and sorting responsiveness

8. **Migration Status Page**
   - During migration, navigate to `/migration-status`
   - Verify real-time progress updates
   - Check phase completion indicators

9. **Cache Invalidation**
   - After migration, run `npm run cache:clear`
   - Refresh application
   - Verify all data loads correctly without stale cache

10. **Report Generation**
    - Run `npm run migrate:report`
    - Open generated HTML report in `logs/reports/`
    - Verify all sections display with success indicators
