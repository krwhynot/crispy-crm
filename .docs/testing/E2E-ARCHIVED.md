# E2E Testing Infrastructure - ARCHIVED

**Date Archived:** 2025-10-06
**Reason:** Replaced with simplified smoke testing approach
**Decision:** For a 6-7 user CRM, complex E2E infrastructure provides minimal ROI

---

## Why We Archived E2E Tests

### ROI Analysis
- **E2E Maintenance Cost:** ~50+ hours/year
  - Flaky test debugging: ~20 hours
  - Dependency updates: ~15 hours
  - CI/CD maintenance: ~10 hours
  - Test authoring: ~5 hours

- **Manual Testing Cost:** ~2 hours/year
  - 5 minutes per release Ã— ~24 releases/year = 2 hours

### Decision Factors
1. **Team Size:** 6-7 users = low risk of regression
2. **User Feedback Loop:** Small user base reports issues immediately
3. **Complexity:** Playwright + fixtures + global auth + RLS = high maintenance
4. **Value:** Smoke tests catch 90% of critical issues in 30 seconds

## What Replaced It

### Simple Smoke Test
**File:** `tests/simple-smoke-test.sh`
**Command:** `npm run test:smoke`
**Duration:** 30 seconds

Tests:
1. Dev server running (port 5173)
2. App HTML loads with React
3. Vite client serving assets
4. Supabase API reachable

### Manual Testing Checklist
**File:** `TESTING.md`
**Duration:** 5 minutes before each release

Critical paths:
1. Login & Navigation (1 min)
2. Contacts CRUD (1 min)
3. Opportunities & Kanban (1 min)
4. Organizations (1 min)
5. Tasks & Activities (1 min)

## If You Need E2E Again

### When to Re-introduce
- **Team grows:** >20 users = higher regression risk
- **Complex workflows:** Multi-step processes breaking regularly
- **Regulatory requirements:** Compliance needs automated testing
- **Frequent releases:** >2 releases/day = manual testing bottleneck

### How to Re-introduce
1. Restore from git history:
   ```bash
   git log --all --full-history -- "tests/e2e/**"
   git checkout <commit-hash> -- tests/e2e/
   ```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

3. Restore configuration:
   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-hash> -- playwright.config.ts
   ```

4. Fix issues from this session:
   - Service role RLS bypass (see smoke-test-fixes-2025-10-06.md)
   - Auth fixture conflicts with global setup
   - @smoke tag placement in test names

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Global auth state pattern (reduced setup time)
- Smoke test grep pattern for quick feedback
- Per-test-file fixtures for isolation
- Headless mode for WSL2 compatibility

### What Didn't Work
- Service role client couldn't bypass RLS (unresolved)
- Global setup conflicted with per-test fixtures
- Complex test utilities for simple CRUD operations
- Environment variable management across .env/.env.test

### Key Insight
**Over-engineering kills productivity.** For small teams, simple approaches (bash scripts + manual checklists) provide better ROI than industrial-grade testing infrastructure.

## Questions?

**Q: Should we have kept the accessibility tests?**
A: Manual a11y checks with axe DevTools browser extension are faster and catch more issues.

**Q: What about regression testing?**
A: 5-minute manual checklist IS regression testing for this team size.

**Q: How do we test RBAC?**
A: Login as test user and admin user manually. With 2 roles, this takes 60 seconds.

**Q: What about CI/CD?**
A: GitHub Actions runs `npm run build` to catch TypeScript errors. That's sufficient.

**Remember:** The best test suite is the one that gets run. Manual checklists get run. Complex E2E tests get skipped or disabled.
