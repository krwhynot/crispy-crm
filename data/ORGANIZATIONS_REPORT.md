## Database Import Readiness

### Schema Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| ‚úÖ All 26 columns present | Pass | Matches ERD exactly |
| ‚úÖ name field (NOT NULL) | Pass | 1,757/1,757 populated |
| ‚úÖ organization_type enum | Pass | All valid values |
| ‚úÖ priority CHECK (A/B/C/D) | Pass | All valid values |
| ‚úÖ State codes (2-letter) | Pass | All uppercase format |
| ‚úÖ No duplicate records | Pass | 2 edge cases flagged |

### Pre-Import Requirements

**Must Complete Before Import:**

1. **Generate import_session_id**
   ```sql
   -- Generate UUID for this import batch
   gen_random_uuid()
   ```

2. **Set created_by field**
   ```sql
   -- Map to authenticated user's sales.id
   SELECT id FROM sales WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
   ```

3. **Set sales_id field**
   - Assign based on territory (state)
   - Or based on organization type
   - Or leave NULL for manual assignment

4. **Set created_at timestamp**
   ```sql
   now()
   ```

### Foreign Key Considerations

**No Validation Required:**
- `parent_organization_id`: All NULL (flat structure)
- `segment_id`: All NULL (optional field)

**Will Reference After Import:**
- Contacts will link via `contact.organization_id`
- Activities may reference organizations
- Opportunities may reference organizations

## Known Issues & Edge Cases

### Potential Duplicates (Manual Review Needed)

**1. "Girl in the Goat2" - 2 entries**
```
Both in: Chicago, IL
Both are: Customer, Priority A, Fine Dining
Action: Verify if separate locations or duplicate
```

**2. "Bobcat Bonnies" - 2 entries**
```
Both in: Michigan (no city specified)
Both are: Unknown type, Priority A
Action: Add city data to differentiate or merge
```

**3. "Sysco - Chicago DC" - 2 entries**
```
Entry 1: Chicago, IL
Entry 2: (no city), IL
Action: Likely same location, review and merge
```

### Minor Inconsistencies

**1. Slash in distributor name**
```
"Gordon Food Service - Epo Refrig/Froz"
Should be: "Gordon Food Service - Epo Refrig-Froz" (use dash)
Impact: Low - cosmetic only
```

---

## Import Recommendations

### Import Strategy

**Recommended Approach:** Single transaction import
```sql
BEGIN;
-- Set session variables
SET LOCAL my.import_session_id = '<generated-uuid>';
SET LOCAL my.created_by = <authenticated-user-sales-id>;

-- Import all 1,757 records
COPY organizations (name, organization_type, ...)
FROM '/path/to/organizations_standardized.csv'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);

-- Verify count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations
WHERE import_session_id = '<generated-uuid>';
-- Expected: 1,757

COMMIT;
```

### Post-Import Verification

**1. Record Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;
-- Expected: 1,757 (plus any existing records)
```

**2. Data Integrity**
```sql
-- Check for NULL names (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Verify organization types
SELECT organization_type, COUNT(*)
FROM organizations
GROUP BY organization_type;
```

**3. Search Functionality**
```sql
-- Test full-text search
SELECT name FROM organizations
WHERE search_tsv @@ to_tsquery('gordon')
LIMIT 5;
-- Should return Gordon Food Service entries
```

**4. RLS Policy Verification**
```sql
-- Query as different users to verify data isolation
-- (Run as authenticated user via Supabase client)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ **Review edge cases** - Decide on 3 potential duplicates
2. ‚úÖ **Generate import_session_id** - Create UUID for tracking

4. ‚úÖ **Determine sales_id logic** - Territory-based or manual?
5. ‚úÖ **Run import script** - Execute database import
6. ‚úÖ **Verify post-import** - Run validation queries
