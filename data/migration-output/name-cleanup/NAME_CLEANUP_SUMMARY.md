## Issues Flagged for Review

### Critical Issues (30 entries)

**1. Multiple People Detected (16 entries - P0-CRITICAL)**
- Risk: Data loss if treated as single contact
- Examples:
  - "David Tsirekas Craig Richardson"
  - "Chris and Susie Maloyan -OWNERS"
  - "Jenner Tomaska and wife Katrina Bravo"
  - "Joe Doran culinary Director, Ryan Nilson, senior executive culinary Director..."

**2. Ambiguous Parsing (14 entries - P1-HIGH)**
- Cannot determine correct name/title split with confidence
- Examples:
  - "Seth Minton chef de cuisine" - Is "cuisine" part of title or name?
  - "Pastry Chef Schawecker" - Which words are title vs name?
  - "GFS Kathy Lyons" - Is GFS part of name or abbreviation?

### Guided Review Issues (67 entries)

**1. No Rule Matched (36 entries)**
- Unusual patterns not covered by automated rules
- Options provided for user selection

**2. Title Suffix (14 entries)**
- Title words mixed with name, needs verification
- Multiple correction options suggested

**3. Multiple People (Minor cases)**
- Cases where "and" might be part of name vs multiple people
- User judgment needed
