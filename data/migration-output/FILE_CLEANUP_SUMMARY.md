- All CSV files imported successfully
- All duplicate organizations renamed
- Zero duplicate organization names

✅ **Verification Complete:**

## Cleanup Rationale

### Why These Files Were Removed

**Superseded CSV Files:**
- `contacts_cleaned.csv` and `organizations_cleaned.csv` were early versions before applying the 85% confidence threshold cleanup. They contained the initial name parsing but lacked the final corrections and notes preservation. The `_final.csv` versions are the authoritative, production-ready data.

**Intermediate Processing Files:**
- Files like `contacts_to_keep_corrected.csv` were intermediate outputs used to generate the final CSVs. Once applied, they serve no purpose and can be regenerated from the scripts if needed.

**Abandoned Multi-Tier Approach:**
- The initial strategy involved manual review worksheets and multi-tier corrections. This was replaced with the simplified 85% confidence threshold approach. All files from the old approach are obsolete.

**Duplicate Analysis Files:**
- `DUPLICATE_ORGANIZATIONS_REPORT.csv` listed all 404 duplicate records. After renaming, there are 0 duplicates, making this file obsolete.
- `DUPLICATE_ORGANIZATIONS_SUMMARY.md` analyzed the original problem. The complete solution is documented in `ORGANIZATION_RENAMING_COMPLETE.md`.

### Why These Files Were Kept

**Production CSV Files:**
- These are the final, validated, production-ready data files. They represent the culmination of all cleanup, corrections, and transformations.

**Documentation:**
- Each markdown file documents a critical phase of the migration:
  - `FINAL_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Name cleanup strategy
  - `DATABASE_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Import process
  - `DUPLICATE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - Safe deletion phase
  - `ORGANIZATION_RENAMING_COMPLETE.md` - Final deduplication
  - `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Reference for future migrations

**Scripts:**
- `apply_cleanup.py` and `simplified_cleanup_script.py` are the actual code that transformed the data. They serve as documentation and can be reused if similar data issues arise.
- `rename_duplicates_with_city.sql` can be reused if new duplicates are imported.

## Next Steps (If Needed)

### If You Need to Re-Import

1. **Local Database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:local:reset  # Reset local Supabase
   npm run dev             # Verify empty database
   ```

2. **Import CSVs in Order:**
   ```sql
   -- 1. Segments
   \COPY segments_staging FROM '/path/to/segments_import.csv' CSV HEADER;

   -- 2. Organizations
   \COPY organizations_staging FROM '/path/to/organizations_final.csv' CSV HEADER;

   -- 3. Contacts
   \COPY contacts_staging FROM '/path/to/contacts_final.csv' CSV HEADER;
   ```

3. **Run Migration Queries:**
   - See `DATABASE_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for complete SQL

### If New Duplicates Appear

1. Detect duplicates:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
   FROM organizations
   GROUP BY name
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

2. Run `rename_duplicates_with_city.sql` script

3. Verify: Should return 0 duplicates
