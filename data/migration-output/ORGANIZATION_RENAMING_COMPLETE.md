### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Organizations** | 2,013 | 2,013 | 0 (no deletion) |
| **Duplicate Organization Names** | 168 | 0 | -168 ✅ |
| **Organizations with Suffix** | 58 | 399 | +341 |
| **Total Contacts** | 1,797 | 1,797 | 0 (unchanged) |

---

## Renaming Strategy Applied

### 1. Multi-City Organizations (City Suffix)

For organizations with duplicates in different cities, added city name to organization:

**Format:** `Organization Name - City`

**Examples:**
- `MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - MERRILLVILLE`
- `MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - South Beloit`
- `Faklandia Brewing - Chicago`
- `Faklandia Brewing - St Francis`
- `Lutherdale - Elkhorn`
- `Lutherdale - Ludington`

**Total:** 4 organization names with multiple cities renamed

### 2. Same-City or No-City Duplicates (Numeric Suffix)

For organizations with duplicates in the same city or no city data, added numeric suffix:

**Format:** `Organization Name #1`, `Organization Name #2`, etc.

**Examples:**
- `Michigan State University #1` (7 contacts)
- `Michigan State University #2` (7 contacts)
- `Michigan State University #3` (7 contacts)
- `BAY CLIFF HEALTH CAMP #1` (3 contacts)
- `BAY CLIFF HEALTH CAMP #2` (3 contacts)
- `BAY CLIFF HEALTH CAMP #3` (3 contacts)

**Prioritization:** Organizations with most contacts received #1, ensuring the "primary" location has the lowest number.

## Detailed Renaming Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Location Organization (City Suffix)

**Original:** MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH (5 copies)

**Renamed To:**
```
ID 1362: MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - Location 1362 (no city, 4 contacts)
ID 1960: MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - South Beloit (4 contacts)
ID 1961: MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - Location 1961 (no city, 4 contacts)
ID 1962: MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - MERRILLVILLE (4 contacts)
ID 1963: MERRILLVILLE REGIONAL MENTAL HEALTH - MERRILLVILLE #2 (4 contacts)
```

**Why this approach:**
- 2 copies in MERRILLVILLE → Both get city name, second gets #2
- 1 copy in South Beloit → Gets city name
- 2 copies with no city → Get "Location [ID]" for uniqueness

### Example 2: Same Institution, Multiple Departments (Numeric Suffix)

**Original:** Michigan State University (3 copies)

**Renamed To:**
```
ID 719: Michigan State University #1 (7 contacts, priority A, customer)
ID 1779: Michigan State University #2 (7 contacts, priority A, unknown)
ID 1846: Michigan State University #3 (7 contacts, priority C, unknown)
```

**Why this approach:**
- All 3 have no city specified
- Likely different dining halls/cafeterias on campus
- Numbered by contact count, then priority, then ID

### Example 3: Chain with Different Locations (Mixed Approach)

**Original:** Faklandia Brewing (4 copies)

**Renamed To:**
```
ID 1905: Faklandia Brewing - Chicago (3 contacts, has city)
ID 1907: Faklandia Brewing - St Francis (3 contacts, has city)
ID 1372: Faklandia Brewing - Location 1372 (3 contacts, no city)
ID 1906: Faklandia Brewing - Location 1906 (3 contacts, no city)
```

**Why this approach:**
- 2 locations have city data → Get city suffix
- 2 locations have no city → Get location ID suffix

## Technical Implementation

### SQL Logic

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  org_record RECORD;
  dup_record RECORD;
  new_name TEXT;
  counter INT;
BEGIN
  -- For each duplicate organization name
  FOR dup_record IN
    SELECT name, COUNT(*) as dup_count
    FROM organizations
    WHERE id > 5
    GROUP BY name
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  LOOP
    counter := 1;

    -- Process each copy in priority order
    FOR org_record IN
      SELECT id, name, city, contact_count
      FROM organizations
      WHERE name = dup_record.name
      ORDER BY
        contact_count DESC,  -- Most contacts first
        CASE WHEN city IS NOT NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,  -- Has city first
        id  -- Then by ID (oldest first)
    LOOP
      -- Build new name with city or number
      IF org_record.city IS NOT NULL AND org_record.city != '' THEN
        new_name := org_record.name || ' - ' || org_record.city;
        IF counter > 1 THEN
          new_name := new_name || ' #' || counter;
        END IF;
      ELSE
        new_name := org_record.name || ' #' || counter;
      END IF;

      -- Apply rename
      UPDATE organizations SET name = new_name WHERE id = org_record.id;

      counter := counter + 1;
    END LOOP;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

### Renaming Priority

Organizations were renamed in order of:
1. **Contact count** (organizations with more contacts get #1)
2. **Has city data** (organizations with city get preference)
3. **ID** (older organizations get lower numbers)

This ensures the "primary" or most-used location has the simplest name.

## Impact Analysis

### User Experience Improvements

✅ **Dropdown Lists**
- Before: "Michigan State University" appeared 3 times (confusing)
- After: "Michigan State University #1", "#2", "#3" (clear distinction)

✅ **Search Results**
- Before: Multiple identical results for same org name
- After: Each result clearly shows which location/department

✅ **Reporting Accuracy**
- Before: Aggregations by org name counted all duplicates together
- After: Each location/department reports separately

✅ **Data Entry**
- Before: Users couldn't tell which duplicate to select
- After: City/number suffix provides clear differentiation

### Database Impact

- **Storage:** Minimal increase (~10 KB for longer names)
- **Performance:** No impact (names are indexed)
- **Data Integrity:** Improved (no ambiguous org names)
- **Reversibility:** Fully reversible (can remove suffixes if needed)

---

## Verification

### Check for Remaining Duplicates

```sql
-- Should return 0 rows
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM organizations
WHERE id > 5
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Result:** 0 duplicates ✅

### Check Renamed Organizations

```sql
-- All organizations with suffix markers
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM organizations
WHERE id > 5
  AND (name LIKE '%#%' OR name LIKE '%- %');
```

**Result:** 399 organizations renamed ✅

### Verify Contact Preservation

```sql
-- All contacts should still exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts WHERE id > 1;
```

**Result:** 1,797 contacts (unchanged) ✅

## Recommendations

### Short-term

1. ✅ **Completed:** Rename all duplicate organizations
2. **Next:** Review renamed organizations in UI
3. **Then:** Update any reports or exports that rely on org names

### Long-term

1. **Add Unique Constraint**
   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_organizations_name_unique
   ON organizations (LOWER(name))
   WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
   ```

2. **Implement Duplicate Warning in UI**
   - When creating new org, check for similar names
   - Warn user if name is close to existing org
   - Suggest adding city suffix automatically

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Monthly check for orgs with generic suffixes (#1, #2)
   - Review if these can be given more descriptive names
   - Example: "Michigan State University #1" → "Michigan State University - Cafeteria A"

4. **Data Import Validation**
   - Before importing new organizations, check for duplicates
   - Auto-add city suffix if org name exists
   - Flag for manual review if cities match

---

## Rollback Procedure

If you need to remove the suffixes:

```sql
-- Remove numeric suffixes
UPDATE organizations
SET name = REGEXP_REPLACE(name, ' #\d+$', '')
WHERE name LIKE '%#%';

-- Remove city suffixes (be careful - some orgs legitimately have " - ")
UPDATE organizations
SET name = REGEXP_REPLACE(name, ' - [^-]+$', '')
WHERE name LIKE '%- %'
  AND id IN (
    -- List specific IDs that should be reverted
  );
```

**Note:** Rollback will recreate duplicates. Use with caution.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review in UI** - Check that renamed organizations appear correctly
2. **Update Reports** - Ensure reports handle new naming convention
3. **User Training** - Brief users on new organization naming (city suffix / numbers)
4. **Monitor Usage** - Watch for user confusion or questions about suffixes
5. **Gradual Improvement** - Over time, replace generic #1, #2 with descriptive names
