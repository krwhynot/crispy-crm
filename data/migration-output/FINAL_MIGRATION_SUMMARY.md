---

## Cleanup Strategy Applied

### 85% Confidence Threshold Approach

**High Confidence (≥85%) - Auto-Corrected:**
- 37 entries at 95-100% confidence (Very high certainty)
- 16 entries at 90-94% confidence (High certainty)
- 2 entries at 85-89% confidence (Good certainty)

**Examples of Auto-Corrections:**
```
"Chef Saul Ramos" → first="Saul", last="Ramos", title="Chef"
"Jay-GM" → first=NULL, last="Jay-GM", title=NULL (kept as compound)
"General Manager Jensen" → first=NULL, last="General Manager Jensen"
```

**Low Confidence (<85%) - Moved to Organization Notes:**
- 74 entries without email/phone → deleted after noting (safe)
- 24 entries with email/phone → preserved in notes (critical)

**Examples of Preserved Entries:**
```
Organization: Angie's
  Note: "Contact: President | Email: osroc44@yahoo.com"

Organization: Direct Food Services
  Note: "Contact: Nick De Astis | Email: Ndeastis@direct-foods.com | Phone: 630-350-2171"
```

## Data Preservation Verification

### Critical Entries with Email/Phone (24 total)

All 24 entries have been verified to preserve contact information:

✅ **Email Preservation Examples:**
- President at Angie's → Email: osroc44@yahoo.com
- Nick De Astis at Direct Food Services → Email: Ndeastis@direct-foods.com

✅ **Phone Preservation Examples:**
- Michael campenil - Greco at Arlington Tap House → Phone: +1 (224) 715-0405

## Migration Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Validation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] All 55 corrections applied
- [x] All 93 organization notes added
- [x] All 74 safe deletions completed
- [x] Critical email/phone data verified preserved

### Phase 2: Database Import (Next Steps)

1. **Import Segments** (30 records)
   ```sql
   COPY segments(name) FROM 'segments_import.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
   ```

2. **Import Organizations** (2,025 records)
   ```sql
   -- Match segment_name to segment_id via lookup
   INSERT INTO organizations (name, segment_id, organization_type, priority, notes, ...)
   SELECT
     o.name,
     s.id AS segment_id,
     o.organization_type,
     o.priority,
     o.notes,  -- Contains preserved contact data!
     ...
   FROM organizations_staging o
   LEFT JOIN segments s ON o.segment_name = s.name;
   ```

3. **Import Contacts** (1,572 records)
   ```sql
   -- Match organization_name to organization_id via lookup
   INSERT INTO contacts (first_name, last_name, name, title, email, phone, organization_id, ...)
   SELECT
     c.first_name,
     c.last_name,
     c.name,
     c.title,
     c.email::jsonb,
     c.phone::jsonb,
     o.id AS organization_id,
     ...
   FROM contacts_staging c
   LEFT JOIN organizations o ON c.organization_name = o.name;
   ```

### Phase 3: Post-Migration Validation

- [ ] Verify contact count: 1,572
- [ ] Verify organization count: 2,025
- [ ] Verify segment count: 30
- [ ] Spot-check 10 corrected contacts
- [ ] Verify organization notes searchable in UI
- [ ] Test email/phone JSONB queries
- [ ] Verify all organization-contact relationships

## Quality Metrics & Success Criteria

### Data Quality

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Contact count reduction | ~74 | 74 | ✅ |
| Corrections applied | 55 | 55 | ✅ |
| Organization notes added | ~98 | 93* | ✅ |
| Data loss | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Email/phone preservation | 24 | 24 | ✅ |

*Note: 93 organizations vs 98 entries due to some organizations having multiple notes

### Confidence Distribution

| Range | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 95-100% | 37 | 67.3% |
| 90-94% | 16 | 29.1% |
| 85-89% | 2 | 3.6% |

**Average Confidence:** 94.2%

## Industry Standards Applied

### Name Field Conventions (Per Salesforce/HubSpot/Dynamics)

✅ **Single names → last_name** (NOT first_name)
- Example: "Yu" → first=NULL, last="Yu"
- Rationale: Last name is primary identifier in CRM search/sort

✅ **Title extraction from compound names**
- Example: "Chef Bill Kim" → first="Bill", last="Kim", title="Chef"

✅ **Preserve original name in 'name' field**
- Enables search by original input
- Maintains data integrity

### Contact Data Format (Industry Standard JSONB)

```json
// Email format
[{"type":"main","value":"user@example.com","primary":true}]

// Phone format
[{"type":"main","value":"+1 (555) 123-4567","primary":true}]

// NULL for empty (not empty array)
NULL
```

## Next Steps for Database Migration

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Validation Report**
   - Open `name-cleanup/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
   - Verify all checklist items
   - Spot-check 5-10 sample entries

2. **Create Staging Tables** (see MIGRATION_GUIDE.md Phase 2)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE segments_staging (...);
   CREATE TABLE organizations_staging (...);
   CREATE TABLE contacts_staging (...);
   ```

3. **Import CSV Files**
   ```bash
   psql -c "\COPY segments_staging FROM 'segments_import.csv' CSV HEADER"
   psql -c "\COPY organizations_staging FROM 'organizations_final.csv' CSV HEADER"
   psql -c "\COPY contacts_staging FROM 'contacts_final.csv' CSV HEADER"
   ```

4. **Run Migration SQL**
   - Execute lookup joins for segment_id, organization_id
   - Cast JSONB columns for email/phone
   - Verify foreign key relationships

5. **Post-Migration Validation**
   - Run count queries
   - Test organization notes search
   - Verify email/phone JSONB queries work
   - Spot-check corrected names in UI

### Support & Rollback

**If Issues Arise:**
- All original data preserved in `contacts_cleaned.csv` and `organizations_cleaned.csv`
- Migration can be rolled back and re-run
- Organization notes contain original contact data for re-parsing

**Contact Data Recovery:**
- 24 critical entries with email/phone preserved in organization notes
- Format: `Contact: [name] | Email: [email] | Phone: [phone]`
- Can be extracted and converted back to contact records if needed
