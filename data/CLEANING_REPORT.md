## Recommendations

### For Database Import
1. ✅ Use `organizations_cleaned.csv` instead of original file
2. ✅ Set `import_session_id` to track this batch (suggest: UUID)
3. ✅ Map `created_by` and `sales_id` to authenticated user
4. ✅ The `search_tsv` field will auto-populate via database triggers

### Data Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Email addresses:** 0% populated - consider enrichment
2. **Websites:** 0% populated - could be auto-discovered
3. **Phone numbers:** Only 4.1% have phone - opportunity for data collection
4. **Complete addresses:** Only 3.2% complete - gradual improvement over time

### Future Imports
1. Run new data through `clean_organizations.py` before import
2. Consider adding email/website validation
3. Add duplicate detection by name similarity
4. Implement data quality scoring
