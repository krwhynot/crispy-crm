## Transformation Details

### Step 1: Data Cleaning

**Script:** `scripts/clean_contacts.py`

**Actions Performed:**

1. **Name Parsing**
   - Extracted first_name and last_name from single "FULL NAME" field
   - Handled formats: "Last, First", "First Last", single names
   - Parsed embedded titles: "Chef Manager Tinaglia" → first="Chef", last="Tinaglia", title="Manager"

   Examples:
   ```
   "Yu" → first_name="", last_name="Yu"
   "Jay-GM" → first_name="", last_name="Jay-", title="Gm"
   "GIUSEPPE TENTORI" → first_name="Giuseppe", last_name="Tentori"
   "Chef Cardelli" → first_name="", last_name="Cardelli", title="Chef"
   ```

2. **Phone Number Standardization**
   - Converted to E.164 format: `+1XXXXXXXXXX`
   - Examples:
     ```
     "+1 (224) 735-2450" → "+12247352450"
     "(312) 337-6070" → "+13123376070"
     ```
   - Result: 414 phones standardized

3. **Email Validation**
   - Converted to lowercase
   - Removed invalid formats
   - Filtered placeholder domains (example.com, noemail.com)
   - Result: 823 valid emails

4. **State Standardization**
   - Converted to 2-letter codes
   - "Illinois" → "IL"
   - Result: 360 states standardized

### Step 2: Organization Mapping

**Script:** `scripts/populate_org_mapping.py`

**Process:**
1. Extracted 1,122 unique organization names from contacts
2. Matched against standardized organizations (1,757 orgs)
3. Used normalized name matching (case-insensitive, trimmed)
4. Assigned sequential IDs (1-1,757)

**Results:**
- ✅ Matched: 922 organizations (82.2%)
- ⚠️ Unmatched: 200 organizations (17.8%)

**Unmatched Organizations:**
These need manual review or new organization records created:
- Single character names (e.g., "5")
- Location-specific variants (e.g., "ALINEA (Chicago)")
- Misspellings or data entry errors
- New organizations not in standardized list

### Step 3: Database Format Transformation

**Script:** `scripts/transform_contacts_for_db.py`

**JSONB Transformations:**

The Atomic CRM database uses JSONB arrays for contact methods to support multiple emails/phones per contact.

**Email Format:**
```csv
Source: "tellez@aactax.com"
Database: [{"email": "tellez@aactax.com", "type": "work"}]
```

**Phone Format:**
```csv
Source: "+12247352450"
Database: [{"number": "+12247352450", "type": "work"}]
```

**Empty Values:**
```csv
No email/phone: []
```

**Benefits of JSONB Format:**
- Supports multiple contact methods per person
- Can add types: work, home, mobile, other
- Can add labels: "Direct Line", "Assistant", etc.
- Extensible without schema changes

## Import Instructions

### Pre-Import Requirements

Before importing, you'll need to set these fields via application logic or SQL:

```sql
-- Option 1: Import with defaults
COPY contacts (
  name, first_name, last_name, email, phone, title,
  department, organization_id, address, city, state,
  postal_code, country, linkedin_url, notes
)
FROM '/path/to/contacts_db_ready.csv'
CSV HEADER;

-- Option 2: Import with sales_id assignment
-- (Requires business logic to assign sales reps)
```

### Post-Import Steps

1. **Assign Sales Reps (sales_id)**
   ```sql
   UPDATE contacts
   SET sales_id = assign_sales_rep_by_territory(state, organization_id)
   WHERE sales_id IS NULL;
   ```

2. **Verify Import**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts;
   -- Expected: 2,013

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts WHERE email != '[]';
   -- Expected: 823

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts WHERE organization_id IS NOT NULL;
   -- Expected: 1,633
   ```

3. **Check JSONB Format**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, email, phone
   FROM contacts
   WHERE jsonb_array_length(email) > 0
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

4. **Verify Search Index**
   ```sql
   -- Triggers should have populated search_tsv
   SELECT name, search_tsv
   FROM contacts
   WHERE search_tsv @@ to_tsquery('giuseppe')
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Known Issues & Manual Review Items

### 1. Missing Organization IDs (380 contacts, 18.9%)

These contacts have organization names that didn't match the standardized list:

**Sample Unmatched Organizations:**
- "5" (invalid name)
- "ACARATH Montessori Center (Schaumburg)" (location-specific)
- "Advanced Accounting Cntr, Ltd" (abbreviation mismatch)
- "Agents Harmony" (not in org database)

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Create new organizations** for valid businesses
2. **Manual matching** for naming variations
3. **Leave as NULL** if organization doesn't exist
4. **Clean up** invalid entries like "5"

### 2. Incomplete Contact Information

**Contacts Missing Both Email AND Phone:** ~800 (40%)
- These can still be imported (not required by schema)
- Can be enriched over time through CRM usage
- Consider data enrichment services

**Contacts With Only Names:** ~584 (29%)
- Have organization but no contact method
- May represent gatekeeper contacts
- Could be placeholders from sales calls

### 3. Name Parsing Edge Cases

Some names may need manual review:

```
"Chef Manager Tinaglia" → first="Chef", last="Tinaglia"
  Should be: first="", last="Tinaglia", title="Chef Manager"

"VP Community Engagement" → first="Community", last="Engagement", title="Vp"
  Should be: first="", last="", title="VP Community Engagement"
  (No actual person name provided)

"SPENCER Beverly" → first="Spencer", last="Beverly"
  Possibly reversed (Beverly Spencer?)
```

### 4. Phone Number Format Issues

Some phone numbers may have lost formatting:
```
"+12247352450.0" (has .0 decimal)
```

This won't break import but may need cleaning.
