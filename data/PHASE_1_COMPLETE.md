### Data Distribution

**Organization Types:**
- unknown: 732 (41.6%)
- customer: 631 (35.9%)
- distributor: 276 (15.7%)
- prospect: 118 (6.7%)

**Priorities:**
- A (High): 856 (48.7%)
- C (Medium): 494 (28.1%)
- D (Low): 218 (12.4%)
- B (Medium-High): 189 (10.8%)

## Remaining Action Item: Duplicate Review ‚ö†Ô∏è

**5 duplicate organization names** require manual review before migration:

| Name | Occurrences | Assessment Needed |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sysco | 2 | One has full address (Elk Grove Village), one is minimal. **Likely duplicate.** |
| Gordon Food Service | 2 | Both are distributors, slightly different data. **Likely duplicate.** |
| Girl in the Goat2 | 2 | Identical records (Chicago, IL, Fine Dining). **Definite duplicate.** |
| Bobcat Bonnies | 2 | Identical records (MI, unknown type). **Definite duplicate.** |
| Sysco - Chicago DC | 2 | Both are distributors in IL. **Likely duplicate.** |

### Recommended Actions

**Option 1: Quick Resolution (Recommended)**
Keep all duplicates as-is for initial migration, then use CRM's built-in duplicate management features to merge them after import. This preserves all data and allows business users to decide on merge strategies.

**Option 2: Pre-Migration Cleanup**
Manually edit `organizations_cleaned.csv` to remove obvious duplicates:
- Keep the record with more complete data (more fields populated)
- Delete the sparser duplicate row
- Document which rows were removed

**Option 3: Add Location Suffixes**
For legitimate separate entities (e.g., different Sysco locations), add distinguishing suffixes:
- `Sysco - Elk Grove Village`
- `Sysco - Unknown Location`

## Next Steps: Database Migration

### 1. Resolve Duplicates (Choose Option 1, 2, or 3 above)

**Recommended:** Option 1 (import as-is, handle in CRM)

### 2. Create Migration Script

Create `scripts/db/seed_organizations.sql`:

```sql
-- Import organizations from cleaned CSV
COPY organizations (
    name, organization_type, parent_organization_id, priority,
    website, phone, email, address, city, state, postal_code,
    notes, logo_url, linkedin_url, annual_revenue, employee_count,
    founded_year, tax_identifier, context_links, sales_id,
    import_session_id
)
FROM '/absolute/path/to/organizations_cleaned.csv'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', NULL '');

-- Update computed flags
UPDATE organizations
SET is_distributor = true
WHERE organization_type = 'distributor';

UPDATE organizations
SET is_principal = true
WHERE organization_type = 'principal';

-- Verify import
SELECT
    organization_type,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE phone IS NOT NULL) as with_phone,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE email IS NOT NULL) as with_email
FROM organizations
GROUP BY organization_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### 3. Test on Local Database

```bash
# Reset local database
npm run db:local:reset

# Run migration script
psql "$LOCAL_DB_URL" -f scripts/db/seed_organizations.sql

# Verify results
npm run dev  # Check in UI
```

### 4. Post-Migration Validation Queries

```sql
-- Check total count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;  -- Should be 1757 (or 1752 if duplicates removed)

-- Verify no null names
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations WHERE name IS NULL;  -- Should be 0

-- Check data quality
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE phone IS NOT NULL) as has_phone,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE email IS NOT NULL) as has_email,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE notes IS NOT NULL) as has_notes
FROM organizations;

-- Find potential duplicates in database
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM organizations
GROUP BY LOWER(TRIM(name))
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Achievements üéâ

1. **Character Encoding Fixed**: 24 organization names now display correctly (apostrophes, accents)
2. **Notes Enhanced**: 1,296 records now have richer notes combining type descriptions with sales notes
3. **100% Database Compliance**: All organization_type values are valid enum values
4. **Zero Data Loss**: All original data preserved, just cleaned and reorganized
5. **Reproducible Process**: Python script can be reused for future CSV imports

## Technical Insights

### CSV Parsing Lessons Learned

The initial analysis using bash commands (`awk`, `cut`) incorrectly identified "INC" and "LLC" as corrupt organization_type values. These were actually **part of company names** (e.g., "Dixon Fisheries, INC") that were properly quoted in the CSV.

**Key Insight:** When analyzing CSV files with quoted fields containing delimiters:
- ‚úÖ Use proper CSV libraries (Python `csv` module)
- ‚ùå Don't use simple text tools (`awk`, `cut`, `grep`) for field extraction
- ‚úÖ Always test transformations with actual CSV parser to verify correctness

### Data Merging Strategy

The script merged two text fields (description + notes) into a single database column using a structured format:

```
Type: {organization_type_description}

Sales Notes: {sales_context}
```

This preserves both pieces of information in a human-readable format that can be displayed in the CRM UI and searched/filtered effectively.

**Ready for Migration:** ‚úÖ YES (after duplicate review)

**Recommended Next Step:** Choose duplicate handling strategy (Option 1 recommended) and proceed with local database testing.
