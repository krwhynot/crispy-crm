## SQL Import Script

**Location:** `data/principal-products-import.sql`

**What it does:**
1. Inserts 16 principal organizations with priority ratings
2. Matches products to principals using ordered JOIN
3. Sets all products as "active" with USD currency
4. Provides verification queries

**To re-run:**
```bash
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres \
  -f data/principal-products-import.sql
```

---

## Database State After Import

### Complete Counts

```sql
SELECT
  'Organizations (All)' as metric,
  COUNT(*)::text as count
FROM organizations
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Organizations (Principal)', COUNT(*)::text
FROM organizations WHERE organization_type = 'principal'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Organizations (Customer)', COUNT(*)::text
FROM organizations WHERE organization_type = 'customer'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Organizations (Distributor)', COUNT(*)::text
FROM organizations WHERE organization_type = 'distributor'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Contacts', COUNT(*)::text
FROM contacts
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Products', COUNT(*)::text
FROM products
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Segments', COUNT(*)::text
FROM segments;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Organizations (All): **2,041**
- Organizations (Principal): **16**
- Organizations (Customer/Distributor): **2,025**
- Contacts: **1,772**
- Products: **58**
- Segments: **30**

---

## Verification Queries

### Show All Principals with Product Counts

```sql
SELECT
  o.name,
  o.priority,
  COUNT(p.id) as product_count,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT p.category::text, ', ') as categories
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN products p ON p.principal_id = o.id
WHERE o.organization_type = 'principal'
GROUP BY o.id, o.name, o.priority
ORDER BY product_count DESC, o.name;
```

### List Products by Principal

```sql
SELECT
  o.name as principal,
  p.name as product_name,
  p.sku,
  p.category,
  p.list_price,
  p.unit_of_measure
FROM organizations o
JOIN products p ON p.principal_id = o.id
WHERE o.organization_type = 'principal'
ORDER BY o.name, p.name;
```

### Check for Duplicate SKUs

```sql
SELECT sku, COUNT(*) as count
FROM products
GROUP BY sku
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Should return 0 rows
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Add Product Pricing

Currently all products have `list_price = NULL`. To add pricing:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET list_price = 12.99
WHERE sku = 'KAUF-GAR001';
```

### 2. Add Product Descriptions

```sql
UPDATE products
SET description = 'Premium aged white cheddar cheese'
WHERE sku = 'KAUF-CHD001';
```

### 3. Link Products to Customer Organizations

Products can be associated with customer preferences:

```sql
-- Example: Link customer to preferred principals
INSERT INTO contact_preferred_principals (contact_id, principal_id)
SELECT c.id, o.id
FROM contacts c
CROSS JOIN organizations o
WHERE c.name = 'John Smith'
  AND o.name = 'Kaufholds';
```

### 4. Add More Products

For principals with 0 products (Rapid Rasoi, SWAP, Never Better, TCFB, Mrs Ressler's), add their product catalogs later.

---

## UI Verification

**To verify in the CRM UI:**

1. **Navigate to Organizations → Filter by "Principal"**
   - Should see 16 principal organizations
   - Click on "Kaufholds" → Should show 12 products

2. **Navigate to Products**
   - Should see 58 total products
   - Filter by category (Frozen, Dairy, etc.)
   - Check that SKUs are unique

3. **Test Product Creation**
   - Try creating a new product for a principal
   - Verify required fields: name, SKU, category, principal

---

## Important Notes

### Principals Without Products

4 principals have no products yet:
- **Rapid Rasoi** (Priority A)
- **SWAP** (Priority B)
- **Never Better** (Priority B)
- **TCFB** (Priority B)
- **Mrs Ressler's** (Priority B)

These can be added later when product lists are available.

### "Unknown" Category

12 products were categorized as "Unknown" (1 per principal for the last row). These should be reviewed and recategorized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'other' AND name = 'Unknown';
```

### Price Data

All products currently have `list_price = NULL`. This should be populated with actual pricing data.
