## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

### STEP 1: Open the Test Page
1. Open `fix-auth-advanced.html` in your browser
2. You'll see a big yellow box at the top that says "START HERE"
3. Follow the steps in order

### STEP 2: Check If You're Logged In
**Where to look:** The dots at the very top of the page

**What to do:**
1. Click the button labeled "Check Auth"
2. Look at the dot next to "Auth:"

**What it means:**
- 🟢 Green + "Connected" = You're logged in ✅
- 🔴 Red + "Error" = You're NOT logged in ❌

**If you see RED:**
- Type: `test@gmail.com` in the email box
- Type: your password in the password box
- Click the green "Test Login" button
- The dot should turn green

### STEP 3: Test Database Access
**Where to look:** Right side box labeled "Database Diagnostics"

**What to do:**
1. Click "Test All RLS Policies"
2. Watch the list that appears below

**What you'll see:**
```
contacts RLS: ✅ SELECT OK        <- GOOD!
opportunities RLS: ✅ SELECT OK    <- GOOD!
companies RLS: ✅ SELECT OK        <- GOOD!
```

OR

```
contacts RLS: ❌ SELECT denied     <- BAD! Not logged in
opportunities RLS: ❌ SELECT denied <- BAD! Not logged in
```

**What it means:**
- All ✅ = Your login is working and you can access the database
- All ❌ = You're not logged in properly - go back to Step 2

### STEP 4: Test the Known Bug (nb_tasks)
**Where to look:** The red button that says "Test nb_tasks Error"

**What to do:**
1. Click the red "Test nb_tasks Error" button
2. Look at the black box below (the log)

**What you'll see in the log:**
```
✅ Expected error caught: column contacts_summary.nb_tasks does not exist
```

**What it means:**
- **THIS ERROR IS GOOD!** We're testing a known bug
- The app is trying to use a field that doesn't exist
- This confirms the bug exists

---

### STEP 5: Run Complete Health Check
**Where to look:** Bottom section called "System Health Check"

**What to do:**
1. Scroll down to find "System Health Check"
2. Click "Run Full Health Check"
3. Watch the tests run

**What you'll see:**
```
Authentication: ✅ Healthy
Database Connection: ✅ Healthy
RLS Policies: ✅ Healthy
Storage Access: ✅ Healthy
Network Connectivity: ✅ Healthy
JWT Token Valid: ✅ Healthy

Passed: 6/6
```

**What it means:**
- **6/6 = PERFECT!** Everything is working
- **Less than 6/6 = PROBLEMS** - Look for the ❌ marks

## 🔴 COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: Everything shows ❌ red crosses
**Solution:** You're not logged in
1. Enter email: test@gmail.com
2. Enter your password
3. Click "Test Login"
4. Wait for green "Connected"
5. Try tests again

### Problem: "permission denied for table contacts"
**Solution:** Your login expired or isn't working
1. Click "Clear Sessions" (red button)
2. Login again with email and password
3. Try tests again

### Problem: Tests say ✅ but app doesn't work
**Solution:** The tests are passing but the app has a different issue
1. Click "Start Error Monitor"
2. Open your app in another tab
3. Try to use the feature that's broken
4. Come back to the test page
5. Look for errors in the "UI Error Detection" section

## 📊 UNDERSTANDING THE MATRIX

When you click "Show RLS Matrix", you'll see a table:

```
Table        | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE |
contacts     |   ✅   |   ❌   |   ✅   |   ❌   |
```

**What each column means:**
- **SELECT** = Can you READ data? (Should be ✅)
- **INSERT** = Can you CREATE new records?
- **UPDATE** = Can you EDIT existing records?
- **DELETE** = Can you REMOVE records?

**Your results show:**
- ✅ SELECT and UPDATE work
- ❌ INSERT and DELETE are blocked

This is actually CORRECT for your system - it's configured to only allow reading and updating, not creating or deleting.

## 💡 SIMPLE SUMMARY

### Everything is OK if you see:
1. Green dot next to "Auth: Connected"
2. Green dot next to "Database: Connected"
3. All tables show "✅ SELECT OK"
4. Health check shows "6/6 passed"

### You have a problem if you see:
1. Red dots anywhere at the top
2. "❌ SELECT denied" for any table
3. Health check shows less than 6/6
4. You're not logged in (no green "Connected")

### The nb_tasks error is EXPECTED
- This is a known bug we're tracking
- Seeing this error means the test is working correctly
- It's not something you need to fix right now
