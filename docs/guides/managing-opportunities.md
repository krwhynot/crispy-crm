## Section 1: Understanding Opportunities

### What is an Opportunity?

Think of an opportunity as **a potential sale you're working to close**. In everyday terms, it's when you've identified a customer who might want to buy a product, and you're actively working to make that sale happen.

Unlike a simple contact record (which just stores information about a person) or an organization record (which describes a company), an opportunity represents **an active sales pursuit with a goal and timeline**.

**Real-world example:**
You meet a restaurant owner at a trade show who's interested in a new line of organic sauces. That's an opportunity. You'll track your conversations, sample deliveries, feedback, and eventually whether they became a customer or passed on the product.

### How Opportunities Fit Into Your Sales Process

Opportunities sit at the heart of your sales workflow:

1. **Organizations** → Companies you work with (customers, distributors, manufacturers)
2. **Contacts** → People at those organizations (buyers, chefs, decision-makers)
3. **Opportunities** → Active sales you're pursuing with specific contacts at customer organizations
4. **Activities** → Your interactions while working the opportunity (calls, emails, demos)

**The flow:**
You identify a **contact** at a **customer organization** who needs a product from a **principal** (manufacturer), potentially delivered through a **distributor**. You create an **opportunity** to track this potential sale and log **activities** as you work toward closing the deal.

---

## Section 2: Page Layout and Structure

### Overall Organization

The Opportunity page uses a **two-tab layout** to separate information types:

**Tab 1: Details**
- All the core information about the opportunity itself
- Who's involved, what stage it's in, when you expect to close
- Organized into clear sections (explained below)

**Tab 2: Notes & Activity**
- All your interactions related to this opportunity
- Quick-add form for logging new activities
- Historical timeline of everything you've done

### Details Tab Breakdown

The Details tab organizes information into **logical sections**:

#### Top Summary Bar (Always visible)

- **Expected Closing Date** – When you hope to close this deal
- **Stage** – Where this opportunity is in your sales process
- **Priority** – How important this deal is (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

*These three fields give you a quick snapshot of the opportunity at a glance.*

#### Ownership & Source Section

- **Opportunity Owner** – The salesperson responsible for this deal
- **Account Manager** – Who manages the overall customer relationship
- **Lead Source** – How you found this opportunity (trade show, referral, etc.)

#### Organization Details Section

This reflects the **three-way relationship model** in food service brokerage:

- **Customer Organization** *(Required)* – The food service operator who will buy/use the product (restaurant, hotel, hospital, etc.)
- **Principal Organization** *(Optional)* – The manufacturer who makes the product you're selling
- **Distributor Organization** *(Optional)* – The distributor who will deliver the product to the customer

> **💡 Key Insight:** The three-way organization model represents how food brokers operate: you connect **Principals** (manufacturers) with **Customers** (restaurants/operators), often through **Distributors** (food service distribution companies like Sysco or Gordon Food Service). Not all opportunities involve all three—sometimes you work directly with customers.

#### Contacts Section

Lists all the people involved in this opportunity from the customer organization (buyers, chefs, purchasing managers, etc.)

#### Description Section

Free-form text field for any additional notes about the opportunity that don't fit elsewhere.

---

## Section 3: Interactions and Activities

### What's the Difference?

**Activities** come in two types:

1. **Engagements** – Standalone interactions not tied to a specific opportunity (general check-ins, networking)
2. **Interactions** – Activities directly tied to an opportunity (what you'll use most on the Opportunity page)

When you're on an Opportunity page, you're always creating **interactions** because they're connected to that specific sale you're working.

### How Activities Relate to Opportunities

Activities form the **historical record** of your sales effort:
- Every call, email, meeting, or demo you conduct
- Captures what happened, when, and with whom
- Creates a timeline showing your progress

**Why this matters:**
- **Accountability** – Shows what you've done to move the deal forward
- **Knowledge transfer** – If someone else takes over, they see the full history
- **Stage progression** – Certain activities naturally move opportunities to new stages
- **Follow-up tracking** – Never lose track of what needs to happen next

### When to Log Different Activity Types (13 types - PRD v1.11)

| Activity Type | When to Use It | Example |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Call** | Phone conversations | "Called chef to discuss menu fit for new sauce line" |
| **Email** | Email correspondence | "Sent pricing and case pack info to purchasing manager" |
| **Meeting** | In-person or virtual meetings | "Met with owner to present product portfolio" |
| **Site Visit** | Visiting customer location | "Visited kitchen to assess equipment compatibility" |
| **Sample** | Sending product samples | "Shipped sample case of 6 SKUs for tasting" |
| **Demo** | Product demonstrations | "Scheduled tasting for kitchen staff - 3 SKUs" |
| **Proposal** | Formal proposals sent | "Submitted proposal for spring menu changeover" |
| **Negotiation** | Price/terms discussions | "Negotiated volume discount for quarterly commitment" |
| **Follow Up** | Any follow-up contact | "Followed up on samples sent last week" |
| **Referral** | Referral-related contact | "Received referral from Chef Maria - her colleague needs sauces" |
| **Social Media** | LinkedIn, social interactions | "Connected on LinkedIn, shared product video" |
| **Conference** | Trade shows, industry events | "Met at NRA Show booth - interested in gluten-free items" |
| **Other** | Anything else | "Dropped off POS materials at restaurant" |

## Section 4: Data Entry Instructions

### Creating a New Opportunity: Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Enter Basic Information

1. **Opportunity Name** *(Required)* – Give it a descriptive name
   - *Good example:* "Autumn Harvest Restaurant - Organic Sauce Line"
   - *Why:* You'll see this name in lists, so make it meaningful

2. **Description** *(Optional)* – Add context
   - *Example:* "Chef interested in replacing current sauce supplier. Focus on organic, local sourcing angle."

3. **Expected Closing Date** *(Required)* – When do you expect to close this?
   - *Tip:* Be realistic. You can always adjust later.
   - The system will flag dates that pass as "Past" to help you prioritize.

#### Step 2: Set Classification & Tracking

4. **Stage** *(Required, defaults to "New Lead")* – See [Understanding Stages](#understanding-stages) for details

5. **Priority** *(Required, defaults to "Medium")* – How important is this? See [Understanding Priority Levels](#understanding-priority-levels)

6. **Lead Source** *(Optional)* – How did you find this opportunity?
   - Helps track which marketing efforts are working

#### Step 3: Define Relationships

7. **Customer Organization** *(Required)* – WHO will buy the product?
   - Start typing to search existing organizations
   - This is the food service operator (restaurant, hotel, school, etc.)

8. **Principal Organization** *(Optional)* – WHO makes the product?
   - The manufacturer/brand you're representing

9. **Distributor Organization** *(Optional)* – WHO will deliver it?
   - The broadline distributor (Sysco, GFS, PFG, etc.)

10. **Account Manager** *(Optional)* – Who manages the customer relationship?
    - May be you, may be someone else on your team

#### Step 4: Add Contacts *(Required - at least one)*

11. **Contacts** – Select the decision-makers involved
    - *Tip:* The system filters to show only contacts from the Customer Organization you selected
    - Common contacts: Head Chef, Purchasing Manager, General Manager, Owner
    - You can add multiple people who influence the buying decision

#### Step 5: Save

Click "Save" to create the opportunity. You'll be redirected to the opportunity detail page.

### Updating an Existing Opportunity

Navigate to the opportunity and click "Edit". The form looks the same as creation, but:

- **You can change any field** except system-generated ones (ID, creation date)
- **Contacts must not be empty** – You must always have at least one contact
- **Auto-name regeneration** – Click the refresh icon next to the name to auto-generate a new name based on current relationships

### Progressing Through Stages

**There are two ways to move an opportunity to a new stage:**

#### Method 1: Via the Edit Form (Details Tab)
1. Click "Edit" on the opportunity
2. In the "Classification & Tracking" section, change the **Stage** dropdown
3. Click "Save"

#### Method 2: While Logging an Activity (Notes & Activity Tab)
1. Go to the "Notes & Activity" tab
2. Fill out the activity form (Date, Type, Contact, Subject)
3. In the **Stage** dropdown, select the new stage
4. Click "Add Activity"
5. **This does two things at once:**
   - Creates the activity record
   - Updates the opportunity stage

> **💡 Best Practice:** Method 2 is powerful because it **ties stage progression to actual work**. When you log "Had demo with chef - 3 products tested" and move from "Sample/Visit Offered" to "Feedback Logged", you're creating an audit trail that proves the stage change was based on real activity, not guesswork.

## Section 5: Key Concepts Explained

### Understanding Stages

Stages represent **where you are in the sales process**. Think of them as checkpoints on the path from "just met" to "signed contract."

#### The 7 Stages Explained (v1.1 - aligned with PRD v1.11)

| Stage | What It Means | When to Use It | Example |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **New Lead** | Just identified this potential customer | Initial prospect identification, trade show leads | "Met owner at NRA Show, got business card" |
| **Initial Outreach** | Made first contact or following up | After first call, email, or meeting scheduled | "Called to introduce myself and our product line" |
| **Sample/Visit Offered** | Offered to send samples or schedule a visit | When you've offered product samples or proposed a site visit | "Shipped sample case of 6 SKUs to chef" |
| **Feedback Logged** | Received feedback, analyzing fit | After customer has tried product and given input (includes waiting period) | "Chef loved 3 items, passed on 2, pricing concern on 1" |
| **Demo Scheduled** | Planning or scheduled a product demonstration | When you've set a date for formal presentation/tasting | "Scheduled kitchen demo for May 15 - full staff tasting" |
| **Closed - Won** | Customer agreed to buy! | When they've committed to purchase/sign contract | "Signed agreement for 4 SKUs, starting June 1" |
| **Closed - Lost** | Customer declined or went another direction | When they say no or choose a competitor | "Chose competitor due to lower pricing" |

> **Note:** The "Awaiting Response" stage was consolidated into "Feedback Logged" in PRD v1.9 to simplify the pipeline.

#### Stage Progression Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Move stages based on **actual events** (calls, meetings, samples sent)
- Log an activity when you change stages to document why
- Use "Feedback Logged" when waiting on customer response or after receiving feedback
- Be honest about "Closed - Lost" so you can track win rates

**❌ DON'T:**
- Skip stages just to make numbers look good
- Leave opportunities in "New Lead" for months without action
- Move to "Demo Scheduled" unless you have an actual date
- Forget to close opportunities (won or lost) when the decision is made

**When to go backward:**
Sometimes you need to move backwards (e.g., from "Demo Scheduled" back to "Sample/Visit Offered" if they cancel). That's okay! Log an activity explaining why.

### Understanding Priority Levels

Priority tells you **how to allocate your time and energy**.

| Priority | When to Use It | Characteristics | Example |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Must-win, urgent opportunities | Large account, strategic importance, time-sensitive | "National chain pilot - they decide in 2 weeks" |
| **High** | Important opportunities worth extra effort | Good revenue potential, strong fit, engaged buyer | "Award-winning restaurant, chef is excited, menu change in 30 days" |
| **Medium** | Standard opportunities | Typical deal, normal timeline, standard process | "Local bistro, interested but no urgency" |
| **Low** | Long-shot or low-value opportunities | Small account, uncertain fit, low probability | "New café, just opened, may buy in 6 months" |

**Priority guides your daily work:**
- Start your day with **Critical** items
- Block time for **High** priority follow-ups
- Batch **Medium** priority check-ins
- Work **Low** priority when you have downtime

**Tip:** Regularly review and adjust priorities. An opportunity can move from Low to Critical if circumstances change (e.g., chef calls with urgent need).

### Understanding Lead Sources

Lead source tracks **how you found this opportunity**. This information helps your organization understand what marketing and prospecting activities are working.

| Lead Source | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Referral** | Someone recommended you | Referrals often have higher close rates - track who refers you |
| **Trade Show** | Met at industry event | Helps justify trade show booth costs and travel |
| **Website** | Came from your website inquiry | Measures website effectiveness |
| **Cold Call** | You reached out proactively | Tracks success of outbound prospecting |
| **Email Campaign** | Responded to marketing email | Measures email marketing ROI |
| **Social Media** | Found via LinkedIn, Instagram, etc. | Tracks social selling effectiveness |
| **Partner** | Referral from business partner | Measures partner relationship value |
| **Existing Customer** | Current customer interested in new product | Cross-sell/upsell tracking |

**Why track this?**
At the end of the quarter, you can answer: "Where did my best opportunities come from?" This guides where to invest time and marketing budget.

### Understanding Required vs. Optional Fields

**Required Fields (Can't save without these):**
- ✅ **Opportunity Name** – What you call it
- ✅ **Expected Closing Date** – When you hope to close
- ✅ **Customer Organization** – Who will buy
- ✅ **Contacts** – At least one decision-maker (required at creation)
- ✅ **Stage** – Defaults to "New Lead" if you don't choose
- ✅ **Priority** – Defaults to "Medium" if you don't choose

**Optional Fields (Nice to have, but not required):**
- Description
- Account Manager
- Principal Organization
- Distributor Organization
- Lead Source

**Why some fields are required:**
You can't have a meaningful opportunity without knowing **who** might buy (customer organization), **who** you're talking to (contacts), and **when** you hope to close (timeline). The other fields add context but aren't essential.

## Section 6: Best Practices

### Tips for Using the Opportunity Page Effectively

#### 1. Update Regularly
- **Set a weekly review time** to update all your opportunities
- Move opportunities through stages as things happen, not in batches
- Keep expected closing dates realistic—adjust when circumstances change

#### 2. Log Activities as You Go
- **Don't wait until end of day/week** to log activities
- Right after a call or meeting, take 30 seconds to log it
- Use the Notes & Activity tab's quick-add form for speed
- **Tie activities to stage changes** for a complete audit trail

#### 3. Maintain Clean Contact Lists
- **Add all influencers**, not just the final decision-maker
- Remove contacts who leave the organization
- Mark the primary decision-maker in your notes

#### 4. Use Priority Strategically
- **Review priorities weekly** as deals heat up or cool down
- Don't mark everything "Critical" (defeats the purpose)
- Be honest about "Low" priorities—it's okay to have long-shots

#### 5. Track Lead Sources Consistently
- **Choose the TRUE source**, not the most recent touchpoint
- If you met at a trade show but they later found your website, the source is "Trade Show"
- Consistent tracking = useful analytics

#### 6. Close Opportunities (Won or Lost)
- **Don't let opportunities linger** in active stages forever
- When you get a "yes" → Closed Won (celebrate!)
- When you get a "no" → Closed Lost (learn from it)
- Archive completed opportunities to keep your pipeline clean

#### 7. Use the Three-Way Organization Model
- **Always set Customer** (who buys)
- **Add Principal when relevant** (whose product are you selling)
- **Add Distributor when it affects the deal** (especially for logistics, pricing, or relationship dynamics)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### ❌ Mistake 1: Creating Opportunities Without Contacts
- **Why it's bad:** Opportunities are about *people*, not just companies
- **Fix:** Always add at least one contact. If you don't have a specific contact yet, get one before creating the opportunity.

#### ❌ Mistake 2: Never Closing Opportunities
- **Why it's bad:** Your pipeline looks bloated, you can't track win rates, reporting is meaningless
- **Fix:** Be disciplined about moving to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost" when decisions are made

#### ❌ Mistake 3: Skipping Activity Logging
- **Why it's bad:** No history, can't prove effort, teammates can't help if you're out
- **Fix:** Make it a habit—log while still on the phone or immediately after

#### ❌ Mistake 4: Setting Unrealistic Closing Dates
- **Why it's bad:** Destroys forecast accuracy, creates false urgency
- **Fix:** Be honest about timelines. A 6-month close date is better than constantly moving a 2-week date

#### ❌ Mistake 5: Using Vague Opportunity Names
- **Why it's bad:** "New Opportunity #5" tells you nothing when scanning lists
- **Fix:** Use format like "[Customer Name] - [Product/Need]"

#### ❌ Mistake 6: Forgetting to Update Stages
- **Why it's bad:** Pipeline reports are inaccurate, you lose track of next steps
- **Fix:** When you log an activity, ask yourself "Did the stage change?" Update accordingly.

#### ❌ Mistake 7: Marking Everything "High" or "Critical" Priority
- **Why it's bad:** When everything is high priority, nothing is
- **Fix:** Reserve "Critical" for genuinely urgent must-wins (maybe 5-10% of your pipeline)

#### ❌ Mistake 8: Not Using Lead Source
- **Why it's bad:** Can't measure marketing effectiveness or double down on what works
- **Fix:** Make it a habit when creating opportunities—take 2 seconds to select the source

- Stage: "Feedback Logged" (awaiting final decision)

**Week 5:**
- Activity: "Call" - "Chef approved! Starting with 3 SKUs, delivery via Sysco Chicago weekly."
- Stage: "Closed Won"

### What You Accomplished

## Need Help?

### Can't find a contact?
→ Make sure you selected the Customer Organization first. The contact list filters to show only people from that organization.

### Stage dropdown not showing your options?
→ Your organization may have customized stages. Ask your CRM administrator for your specific stage list.

### Expected closing date in the past?
→ The system will flag it with a "Past" badge. Update to a realistic future date or close the opportunity if the deal is dead.

### Want to change the opportunity owner?
→ Contact your CRM administrator. Ownership changes typically require admin permissions.

### Lost track of what stage means what?
→ Refer to [Understanding Stages](#understanding-stages) in this guide!

## Technical Notes

> **💡 System Design Insight:** The Opportunity page design reflects a **sampling-based food service sales cycle**. Unlike software or manufacturing sales that might have stages like "Qualification" or "Contract Negotiation," this system follows the physical reality of food sales: *send samples → get feedback → demonstrate in kitchen → close deal*. Understanding this workflow is key to using the system effectively.
