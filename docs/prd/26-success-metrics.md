## 7. SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs

**Primary Goal:** Replace Excel spreadsheets with a faster, searchable CRM system.

### 1. Excel Replacement (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **Target**: Old Excel sheets abandoned within 30 days
- **Measure**: Are team members still opening Excel files for CRM data?
- **Success Signal**: All opportunity tracking happens in CRM, Excel is archive-only

### 2. Data Entry Speed
- **Target**: Data entry is faster than Excel
- **Measure**: Time to create new opportunity (before: Excel, after: CRM)
- **Success Signal**: Users voluntarily choose CRM over Excel for new data

### 3. Search & Findability
- **Target**: Can find information quickly
- **Measure**: Time to find a contact/organization/opportunity
- **Success Signal**: Users stop asking "Where's that info?" in team chat

### 4. User Adoption
- **Target**: 100% team uses CRM daily within 60 days
- **Measure**: Daily active users / Total team size
- **Success Signal**: All team members log at least one activity per week

### 5. Principal Tracking (Key Feature)
- **Target**: All opportunities have Principal assigned
- **Measure**: % of opportunities with valid Principal organization
- **Success Signal**: "Opportunities by Principal" report is used weekly

### 6. Technical Performance
- **Target**: Fast enough that users don't complain
- **Measure**: Page load <3 seconds, interactions <500ms
- **Success Signal**: No "app is slow" feedback in first month

### 7. Data Quality
- **Target**: Clean, usable data
- **Measure**: % of opportunities with required fields complete
- **Success Signal**: Reports don't show "Unknown" or missing data

**Post-Launch Evaluation (30 Days After):**
- Survey team: "Is the CRM better than Excel?" (Yes/No + why)
- Observe: Are people still using Excel? (If yes, understand why)
- Measure: Search time, data entry time (informal timing tests)
