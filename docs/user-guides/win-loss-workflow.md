# Win/Loss Workflow Guide

Properly closing opportunities is crucial for tracking success and learning from losses. This guide explains how to close deals and document the reasons.

## Understanding Closed Stages

There are only two ways to close an opportunity:

| Stage | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Closed - Won** | Deal successful! | First purchase order placed |
| **Closed - Lost** | Deal didn't happen | Customer chose competitor, timing wrong, etc. |

> **Important:** "Won" in Crispy-CRM means the **first purchase order was placed** - not just a verbal commitment or intent to buy.

## Closing an Opportunity as Won

### Step 1: Update the Stage

1. Navigate to the **Opportunity**
2. Change the stage to **Closed - Won**
3. The system will prompt you for a win reason

### Step 2: Select Win Reason (Required)

You must select why you won the deal:

| Win Reason | When to Select |
|------------|----------------|
| **Relationship** | Existing trust with the buyer helped close |
| **Product Quality** | Superior taste, ingredients, or specs won them over |
| **Price Competitive** | Your pricing was better than alternatives |
| **Distributor Preference** | The distributor relationship influenced the decision |
| **Other** | Enter custom reason in the text field |

### Step 3: Add Details

In the notes or "Other" field, add specifics:
- What product(s) were ordered
- Order quantity (if known)
- Key factor that sealed the deal
- Any follow-up commitments made

**Example Win Notes:**
```
Won: First order placed!
- 10 cases Paneer Tikka weekly through Sysco
- Chef loved the portion consistency
- Price was 15% below competitor
- Promised quarterly review meeting
```

### Step 4: Celebrate and Move On

After marking won:
- The opportunity stops appearing in active pipeline
- It won't show stale warnings
- It's preserved for reporting and analysis

## Closing an Opportunity as Lost

Documenting losses is just as important as wins - they help us learn and improve.

### Step 1: Update the Stage

1. Navigate to the **Opportunity**
2. Change the stage to **Closed - Lost**
3. The system will prompt you for a loss reason

### Step 2: Select Loss Reason (Required)

You must select why you lost the deal:

| Loss Reason | When to Select |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Price Too High** | Competitor undercut your pricing |
| **No Distributor Authorization** | Product not available through their distributor |
| **Competitor Relationship** | Buyer already committed to a competitor |
| **Product Not a Fit** | Product didn't match their needs |
| **Timing/Budget** | Not the right time or budget constraints |
| **Other** | Enter custom reason in the text field |

### Step 3: Add Details

Document what happened so we can learn:

**Example Loss Notes:**
```
Lost: Customer went with competitor.
- Price too high - competitor offered 20% less
- Our distributor (Sysco) could match but delivery timing was an issue
- Customer needs product by month-end for menu launch
- May revisit next quarter when they expand menu

Competitor: Regional supplier (didn't get name)
```

### Step 4: Consider Next Steps

Just because it's lost doesn't mean it's over forever:
- Add a task to check back in 3-6 months
- Note any conditions that might change (new menu, ownership change, etc.)
- Consider if a different product might work

## Reopening Closed Opportunities

Sometimes circumstances change and a "lost" deal becomes viable again.

### How to Reopen

1. Navigate to the closed opportunity
2. Change the stage to an active stage (like **Initial Outreach**)
3. The win/loss reason is **automatically cleared**
4. Add a note explaining why it's being reopened

**Example Reopen Note:**
```
Reopening: Customer reached back out.
- Their competitor supplier raised prices
- Want to revisit our proposal
- Scheduling call for next week
```

### What Gets Reset

When you reopen an opportunity:
- Win/loss reason is cleared (you'll need to select a new one if it closes again)
- The opportunity appears in your active pipeline
- Stale detection starts fresh

## Best Practices

### For Wins

- Close promptly when PO is confirmed (don't wait for delivery)
- Be specific about what tipped the deal
- Thank your contact and set expectations for ongoing relationship

### For Losses

- Close immediately when you know it's lost (don't let it sit)
- Document competitor information (helps spot patterns)
- Be honest about the reason (don't blame external factors if it was pricing)
- Consider if there's a future opportunity worth tracking

### For Reopens

- Add context about why it's being reopened
- Reset expectations - treat it like a fresh opportunity
- Review what went wrong last time

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Closing Lost Deals

**Problem:** Leaving lost deals in active stages pollutes your pipeline.

**Solution:** Close lost deals immediately. A clean pipeline = accurate forecasting.

### Mistake 2: Vague Loss Reasons

**Problem:** "They went with someone else" doesn't help us learn.

**Solution:** Be specific. Which competitor? What was their advantage? What could we do differently?

### Mistake 3: Premature Win Claims

**Problem:** Marking "won" before PO is placed, then having to reopen when it falls through.

**Solution:** Only close as won when you have a confirmed purchase order.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting to Follow Up on Losses

**Problem:** Lost deals are forgotten and we miss second chances.

**Solution:** For promising losses, create a follow-up task for 3-6 months out.
