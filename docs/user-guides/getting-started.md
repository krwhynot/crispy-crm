# Getting Started with Crispy-CRM

This guide walks you through your first day using Crispy-CRM, from logging in to understanding the core concepts.

## Logging In

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the CRM URL provided by your administrator
2. Enter your email address and password
3. Click **Sign In**

> **Note:** If you don't have credentials, contact your administrator. Only admins can create new user accounts.

## Understanding the Three-Party Model

Crispy-CRM is built around MFB's unique business model connecting three types of organizations:

```
PRINCIPALS          MFB (You)         DISTRIBUTORS
(Manufacturers) ───────────────────▶ (Sysco, USF, etc.)
                        │
                        ▼
                   CUSTOMERS
                  (Restaurants)
```

### Key Terms

| Term | What It Means | Examples |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Principal** | Food manufacturer whose products MFB represents | McCRUM, Rapid Rasoi, Kaufholds |
| **Distributor** | Company that buys from principals and distributes | Sysco, USF, GFS, PFG |
| **Customer/Operator** | Restaurant or foodservice business (end customer) | Local restaurants, chains |
| **Opportunity** | A potential deal linking Principal + Customer (+ Distributor) | "McCRUM - Sysco - Restaurant ABC" |

## Your First Dashboard View

When you log in, you'll see the **Principal Dashboard** - your home base for daily work.

### What You'll See

1. **Pipeline Table** (left side) - All principals with their opportunity counts and momentum indicators
2. **Tasks Panel** (right side) - Your tasks organized by urgency (Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, This Week)
3. **Log Activity Button** (bottom right) - Quick way to record calls, meetings, and other activities

### Understanding Pipeline Stages

Every opportunity moves through 7 stages:

| Stage | What It Means | Typical Activities |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **New Lead** | Just identified this prospect | Initial research, planning |
| **Initial Outreach** | Made first contact | Intro emails, phone calls |
| **Sample/Visit Offered** | Sent samples or scheduled visit | Sample coordination, site visits |
| **Feedback Logged** | Recorded customer's response | Following up on samples |
| **Demo Scheduled** | Product demonstration planned | Demo prep, scheduling |
| **Closed - Won** | First PO placed! | Celebration, onboarding |
| **Closed - Lost** | Opportunity didn't work out | Document learnings |

## Creating Your First Opportunity

1. Click **Opportunities** in the sidebar
2. Click the **+ Create** button
3. Fill in required fields:
   - **Principal** - Which manufacturer's product
   - **Customer** - Which restaurant/operator
   - **Contact** - Who you're working with (must be from the Customer organization)
4. Optional: Add Distributor, Products, Priority
5. Click **Save**

> **Pro Tip:** The system auto-generates opportunity names like "McCRUM - Sysco - Restaurant ABC" but you can edit this before saving.

## Logging Your First Activity

Activities are the bread and butter of CRM - they track everything you do with customers.

### Quick Log (Under 30 Seconds)

1. Click the **floating action button** (bottom right corner)
2. Select activity type (Call, Email, Meeting, etc.)
3. Choose the contact you spoke with
4. Add a quick note about what happened
5. Click **Save**

### Activity Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Call** | Phone conversations |
| **Email** | Email correspondence |
| **Meeting** | In-person or virtual meetings |
| **Sample** | Product samples sent |
| **Demo** | Product demonstrations |
| **Site Visit** | On-site customer visits |
| **Follow-up** | Scheduled follow-up touchpoints |
| **Note** | Internal notes (not customer-facing) |

## Managing Tasks

Tasks keep you organized and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Viewing Tasks

Your dashboard shows tasks in time buckets:
- **Overdue** (red) - Past due, needs immediate attention
- **Today** - Due today
- **Tomorrow** - Coming up next
- **This Week** - On your radar

### Creating a Task

1. Navigate to an Opportunity or Contact
2. Click **Add Task**
3. Enter:
   - Task description
   - Due date
   - Priority (optional)
4. Click **Save**

### Completing a Task

1. Find the task in your Tasks panel
2. Click the checkbox to mark complete
3. Optionally log an activity to document what you did

## Daily Workflow Recommendation

### Morning (5 minutes)
1. Open CRM dashboard
2. Check overdue tasks (red items need attention!)
3. Review stale deals (yellow/red borders on pipeline)
4. Plan your day's activities

### Throughout the Day
- Log activities as they happen (calls, emails, meetings)
- Update opportunity stages when things progress
- Complete tasks and create follow-ups

### End of Day (5 minutes)
