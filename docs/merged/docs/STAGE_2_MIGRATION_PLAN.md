    list_price,
    specifications
)
SELECT ...
FROM legacy_products;
```

### Relationship Data
```sql

INSERT INTO principal_distributor_contracts (
    principal_id,
    distributor_id,
    contract_start_date,
    status
)
SELECT DISTINCT ...
FROM opportunity_participants
WHERE role IN ('principal', 'distributor');
```
