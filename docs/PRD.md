# Crispy-CRM Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.13
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-28
**Status:** MVP In Progress
**Target Launch:** 30-60 days

> **Changelog v1.13:** Organization Feature Matrix audit - Validated Organization resource against PRD with industry best practices research (Salesforce Accounts, HubSpot Companies via Perplexity). Decisions: (1) Add email field to Organization UI (industry alignment), (2) Keep 2-level hierarchy limit (sufficient for franchises), (3) Change duplicate name validation to soft warning (HubSpot-style), (4) Implement Authorization Tab (#21) and Bulk Reassignment (#20) in parallel. Added MVP features #44-45 (Organization email field, soft duplicate warning). Added resolved questions #79-80. Updated MVP blocker count 35→37. See audit: docs/audits/organization-feature-matrix.md

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision

Crispy-CRM replaces Excel-based sales pipeline management for MFB, a food distribution brokerage managing relationships between Principals (manufacturers), Distributors, and Operators (restaurants).

### 1.2 Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Team Adoption | 100% within 60 days of launch |
| Data Accuracy | <5% error rate |
| Admin Time Reduction | 40% less time on manual tasks |
| Forecast Accuracy | ±15% variance (post-MVP) |

### 1.3 Launch Readiness Criteria

All three must pass before launch:
1. **Feature Completeness** - All MVP features functional
2. **User Acceptance** - Key users approve after testing
3. **Data Migration** - Current year data successfully imported

**Fallback Plan:** Full commitment - no parallel Excel system

---

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 The Problem

**Current State: "Excel Hell"**
- Scattered spreadsheets with no single source of truth
- Manual data entry prone to errors
- Formula dependencies that break
- No real-time pipeline visibility
- Difficult to generate principal reports
- No collaboration features

**Why Not Salesforce/HubSpot?**
- Too expensive for team size (6 account managers)
- Too complex - 90% of features unused
- Can't customize to food brokerage workflow
- Don't own the data

### 2.2 Three-Party Model

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│   PRINCIPALS    │────▶│     MFB     │────▶│   DISTRIBUTORS   │
│ (Manufacturers) │     │  (Broker)   │     │                  │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                    ┌──────────────────┐
                    │    OPERATORS     │
                    │  (Restaurants)   │
                    └──────────────────┘
```

### 2.3 Scale

| Entity | Count | Examples |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Account Managers | 6 | MFB sales team |
| Principals | 9 | McCRUM, Rapid Rasoi, Kaufholds |
| Distributors | 50+ | Sysco, USF, GFS, PFG |

#### 2.3.1 Initial Account Manager Assignments (Seed Data)

The following Principal → Account Manager assignments will be configured during initial data migration:

| Principal | Account Manager | Primary Regions | Key Distributors |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| McCRUM | Brent | IN, KY, TN, OH | HT Hackney, PFG-BG, Sysco Nashville/Louisville/Cincinnati |
| SWAP | Michelle | IL, WI, IN, MI | USF (Streator/Bensenville/WI), Sysco (Chicago/Baraboo/Milwaukee) |
| Rapid Rasoi | Gary | US National (IL, IN, MI, OH, KY, PA focus) | C&U, GFS, HPS, USF accounts |
| ANNASEA | Dale | IL, WI, IN | PFG (all), Greco, Pancho, Wilkens, Chefs Warehouse |
| Kaufholds | Gary | IL, IN, MI, OH, KY, PA | GFS (priority), Lipari, Stanz |
| TCCF | Michelle | TN, KY, IL | Sysco Central, PFG-BG |
| Valley Lahvosh | Sue | IL (Chicago area) | Sysco (Chicago/Baraboo/Milwaukee), European Imports |
| Wicks | Sue | IL (Chicago area) | Sysco Chicago |
| OFK | Sue | IL (Chicago area) | Sysco Chicago |

> **Implementation:** These assignments are handled via database seed/import during initial setup. The system does not enforce territory boundaries—reps manage accounts assigned to them collaboratively.

### 2.4 Key Terminology

| Term | Technical Implementation | Definition |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Organization** | `organizations` table with `type` field | Any company entity in the system |
| **Principal** | Organization with `type = 'principal'` | Food manufacturer whose products MFB represents |
| **Distributor** | Organization with `type = 'distributor'` | Company that buys from principals and distributes |
| **Customer/Operator** | Organization with `type = 'customer'` | Restaurant or foodservice business (end customer) |
| **Opportunity** | `opportunities` table | A deal linking Principal + Distributor + Customer |
| **Authorization** | `authorizations` table (MVP) | When a distributor agrees to carry a principal's products |
| **Won** | `stage = 'closed_won'` | First purchase order placed |

---

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

### 3.1 Role Definitions

| Role | Access Level | Key Activities |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Admin** | Full access | User management, settings, all data, delete/archive, product catalog |
| **Manager** | All reps' data | Pipeline review, reports, reassign opportunities |
| **Rep** | Full visibility (all data) | Log activities, manage opportunities, view dashboards, add products |

**User Provisioning:** Admin-only. Only admins can create new user accounts.

**User Deactivation:** When a rep leaves, manager must manually reassign their opportunities.

### 3.2 Visibility Model

**Team-wide visibility:** All reps can see all opportunities and activities (collaborative/transparent culture).

### 3.3 Delete Permissions

**Soft delete only** - Nothing is truly deleted. Records are archived/hidden.
- Soft delete available to: Record owner, Manager, Admin
- Hard delete: Not permitted (data preservation)

---

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 Core Entities

```
Organization (type: principal) ──── (many) Products
     │                                    │
     │                                    │
     └── (many) Opportunities ────────────┘
              │
              ├── (1) Organization (type: distributor)
              │
              ├── (1) Organization (type: customer)
              │
              ├── (many) Products (via junction table)
              │
              └── (many) Activities
```

### 4.2 Opportunity Structure

**Products per Opportunity:** Database supports multiple products; UI shows primary product with indicator (e.g., "Fryer Oil + 2 more"). Click expands to show all products.

**Links three parties:**
- Principal Organization (whose product) - **Required**
- Customer Organization (end customer/restaurant) - **Required**
- Distributor Organization (who will carry it) - Optional

**Required Fields:**
- Principal Organization
- Customer Organization
- At least one Contact (**must belong to Customer Organization** - enforced by system)

**Contact Requirement:** Contacts cannot exist without an organization. For trade show leads, create an "Unknown" or placeholder organization first, then add the contact.

**Opportunity Naming:**
- Auto-generated with override: System suggests name like "McCRUM - Sysco - Restaurant ABC - 001"
- User can edit before saving

**Optional Fields:**
- Distributor Organization
- Products
- Stage (defaults to `new_lead`)
- Priority (defaults to `medium`)
- Expected close date
- Notes

### 4.3 Product & Pricing

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Catalog Type** | Mixed - some principals have SKUs, others just product names |
| **Fields** | Name, SKU, Category, Status, Description |
| **Pricing** | **Post-MVP** - Volume/price tracking deferred |
| **Permissions** | Any rep can add products to catalog (no approval required) |

> **Note:** Value calculation (Volume × Price) is planned for post-MVP. Current MVP tracks opportunities without monetary values.

**Deal Prioritization:** Use the existing Priority field (Low/Medium/High/Critical) for deal ranking. No deal size field in MVP.

### 4.4 Sample Tracking

**Implementation:** Sample is an activity type with status tracking.

**Status Workflow:**
```
Sent → Received → Feedback Given (positive/negative/pending/no_response)
```

**Status Updates:** Manual entry by rep with system reminders
- Rep manually updates status transitions
- System sends follow-up reminders when follow_up_date approaches
- No shipping API integration (MVP)

**Fields (via Activity record):**
- Activity type = `sample`
- Date sent (activity_date)
- Product sampled (linked product)
- Recipient contact (contact_id)
- Feedback status (custom field)
- Feedback notes (description)
- Follow-up date (follow_up_date)

---

## 5. Pipeline & Stages

### 5.1 Pipeline Stages

**7 stages implemented:**

| # | Value | Label | Description | Visual Decay |
|---|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | `new_lead` | New Lead | Initial prospect identification | No |
| 2 | `initial_outreach` | Initial Outreach | First contact and follow-up | No |
| 3 | `sample_visit_offered` | Sample/Visit Offered | Product sampling and visit scheduling | **Yes** - Critical stage requiring follow-up |
| 4 | `feedback_logged` | Feedback Logged | Recording customer feedback (gate stage) | No |
| 5 | `demo_scheduled` | Demo Scheduled | Planning product demonstrations | No |
| 6 | `closed_won` | Closed - Won | Successful deal completion | No |
| 7 | `closed_lost` | Closed - Lost | Lost opportunity | No |

> **Note:** `awaiting_response` stage removed (v1.9) - consolidated with `sample_visit_offered` which now includes visual decay indicators to surface deals needing follow-up.

### 5.2 Stage Probabilities

**Post-MVP Feature** - Weighted forecasting deferred.

### 5.3 Win/Loss Definitions

**Won:** First purchase order placed (`stage = 'closed_won'`)

**Win/Loss Reasons (Required on close):**

**Win Reasons:**
- Relationship (existing trust with buyer)
- Product quality (superior taste, ingredients, specs)
- Price competitive
- Distributor preference
- Other (free text)

**Loss Reasons:**
- Price too high (competitor undercut)
- No distributor authorization (product not available)
- Competitor relationship (buyer already committed)
- Product not a fit
- Timing/budget
- Other (free text)

### 5.4 Opportunity Lifecycle

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Create** | Required: Principal + Customer + Contact (from Customer Org) |
| **Duplicate** | **Blocked** - System prevents duplicate opportunities |
| **Reopen** | **Allowed** - Win/loss reason is **cleared** (fresh start) |
| **Delete** | **Soft delete only** - Archived, never truly deleted |
| **Reassign** | Manual reassignment by admin/manager |

**Reopen Behavior:** When reopening a closed_won or closed_lost opportunity, the win/loss reason is cleared. If closed again, a new reason must be selected.

---

## 6. Activity Tracking

### 6.1 Activity Types

**13 activity types implemented:**

| Type | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `call` | Phone conversation with contact | Core |
| `email` | Email correspondence | Core |
| `sample` | Product samples sent for evaluation | Core |
| `meeting` | In-person or virtual meeting | Engagement |
| `demo` | Product demonstration | Engagement |
| `proposal` | Formal proposal sent | Sales |
| `follow_up` | Follow-up touchpoint | Sales |
| `trade_show` | Trade show interaction | Event |
| `site_visit` | On-site visit to customer | Engagement |
| `contract_review` | Contract discussion/review | Sales |
| `check_in` | Quick check-in call/message | Relationship |
| `social` | Social media interaction | Relationship |
| `note` | Internal note (not customer-facing) | Admin |

### 6.2 Quick Activity Logging

**Target:** Under 30 seconds per entry

**Required Fields:**
1. Activity type
2. Related entity (Opportunity, Contact, or Organization)
3. Note (free text)

**Auto-captured:**
- Logged by (current user)
- Timestamp
- Duration (optional)

**Activity Auto-Cascade (v1.9):**

When logging an activity on an Opportunity, the system automatically links the activity to the Opportunity's primary Contact.

| User Logs On | Auto-Linked To | Rationale |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Opportunity | Primary Contact | Contact relationship builds over time |
| Contact | — | Direct contact activity, no cascade |
| Organization | — | Org-level activity, no cascade |

**Business Rules:**
- Primary contact = first contact associated with opportunity
- Auto-cascade is silent (no confirmation dialog)
- Activity appears in both Opportunity and Contact timelines
- Contact can be changed manually after logging if needed

### 6.3 Stale Deal Detection

**Definition:** Per-stage thresholds with visual decay indicators

**Per-Stage Stale Thresholds:**

| Stage | Stale Threshold | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| `new_lead` | 7 days | New leads need quick follow-up |
| `initial_outreach` | 14 days | Standard engagement cycle |
| `sample_visit_offered` | 14 days | **Critical** - Visual decay applies here |
| `feedback_logged` | 21 days | Allow time for evaluation |
| `demo_scheduled` | 14 days | Standard engagement cycle |
| `closed_won` / `closed_lost` | N/A | Closed deals don't go stale |

**Visual Decay Indicators (v1.9):**

For `sample_visit_offered` stage (where deals often stall waiting for customer feedback):

| Days Since Activity | Visual Indicator | Border Color |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 0-7 days | Green border | Fresh/Active |
| 8-14 days | Yellow border | Needs attention |
| 14+ days | Red border | Stale/At risk |

**Implementation:** Database view calculates `momentum` field:
- `increasing` - Activity in last 7 days
- `steady` - Activity 8-14 days ago
- `decreasing` - Activity declining
- `stale` - No activity past stage threshold

**Display:** Highlighted on dashboard and opportunity lists with color-coded borders

---

## 7. User Workflows

### 7.1 Rep Daily Workflow

**Morning Start:**
1. Open CRM → Principal dashboard (primary view)
2. Review deals needing attention (stale warnings)
3. Check tasks due today
4. Plan day's activities

**Field Visit (Mobile/Tablet):**
- Full opportunity management capability:
  - Log activities
  - Update opportunity stages
  - Create new opportunities
  - Edit existing opportunities
  - Complete tasks

**End of Day:**
- Ensure all activities logged
- Update opportunity stages as needed
- Review tomorrow's tasks

### 7.2 Manager Weekly Workflow

**Daily:**
- Quick dashboard glance (activity counts, pipeline movement)
- Review team notifications

**Weekly:**
- Formal pipeline review with team
- Review all deals by rep
- Identify blockers and stale deals

### 7.3 Principal Reporting Workflow

1. Select principal
2. Choose date range (custom)
3. Generate report (Excel format)
4. Email to principal

### 7.4 MFB Sales Process Mapping (v1.11)

The CRM pipeline stages align with MFB's established 7-phase sales process. This mapping provides contextual guidance for reps transitioning from the Excel-based workflow.

| MFB Phase | Pipeline Stage(s) | Typical Activities |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Phase 1: Start of Plan** | Pre-CRM | Account manager assignment, principal documentation, sample requests |
| **Phase 2: Planning** | `new_lead` | Define parameters, set goals, distributor analysis |
| **Phase 3A: Target Distributors** | `initial_outreach`, `sample_visit_offered` | Intro emails, presentations, operator calls, sample coordination |
| **Phase 3B: Stocking Distributors** | `feedback_logged`, `demo_scheduled` | Create stock lists, develop marketing campaigns, set appointments |
| **Phase 4: Measuring Results** | All active stages | Monthly sales reports, corrective actions, operator call reviews |
| **Phase 5: Ongoing Activities** | `closed_won` (repeat) | Annual/quarterly goals, promotions, DSR training, food shows |
| **Phase 6: Business Support** | N/A (Accounting) | Commission tracking, order processing, collections |
| **Phase 7: Keep It Going** | Continuous | Review and update all phases quarterly |

> **Note:** Phases 4-7 represent ongoing operational activities that span multiple opportunities. The CRM tracks individual deals through stages while the phases represent the broader sales methodology.

**UI Implementation:** Tooltip help text on the Kanban board will reference this mapping (e.g., "Phase 3A activities typically happen in this stage").

---

## 8. Reporting & Forecasting

### 8.1 Reports Module Overview

The Reports module (`/reports`) provides tabbed access to different report types with a global filter system for consistent data scoping.

**Tabs:**
| Tab | Component | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Overview | `OverviewTab` | Dashboard with KPIs and visualizations |
| Opportunities by Principal | `OpportunitiesByPrincipalReport` | Principal-filtered pipeline analysis |
| Weekly Activity | `WeeklyActivityReport` | 7-day activity summary with rep breakdown |
| Campaign Activity | `CampaignActivityTab` | Track activities tagged to campaigns |

### 8.2 Overview Dashboard

The Overview tab provides at-a-glance KPIs and trend visualizations.

**KPI Cards:**
| KPI | Description | Trend Calculation |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| Total Opportunities | Count of active (non-deleted) opportunities | Compare recent vs older activity periods |
| Activities This Week | Activities logged in current week | Week-over-week comparison |
| Stale Leads | Leads with no activity in 7+ days | Count only (no trend) |

**Charts:**
| Chart | Type | Data Source |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Pipeline by Stage | Bar chart | Opportunity counts per stage |
| Activity Trend (14 Days) | Line chart | Daily activity counts |
| Top Principals by Opportunities | Horizontal bar | Opportunity counts grouped by principal |
| Rep Performance | Grouped bar | Activities + opportunities per rep |

### 8.3 Principal Reports

**Frequency:** Varies by principal (store preference per principal)

**Format:** Excel export (PDF post-MVP)

**Date Range:** Custom date picker

**Available Report Sections:**

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pipeline by Stage | Deal counts at each stage |
| Activity Summary | Calls, emails, samples logged |
| Stale Opportunities | Deals needing attention |

### 8.4 Campaign Activity Report

Track marketing campaign effectiveness through activity tagging.

**Fields:**
- Campaign name (text filter)
- Date range picker
- Activity counts by type
- Associated opportunities

**Export:** CSV with formula injection protection (`sanitizeCsvValue`)

### 8.5 Global Filter System

All report tabs share a global filter context for consistent data scoping.

**Filter Controls:**
| Filter | Type | Persistence |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Sales Rep | Single-select dropdown | localStorage |
| Time Period | Preset options (7d, 30d, 90d, YTD, Custom) | localStorage |
| Custom Date Range | Start/End date pickers | localStorage |

**Implementation:** `GlobalFilterContext` provides filter state to all tabs. Selections persist across tab switches and browser sessions.

**Preset Time Periods:**
- Last 7 Days
- Last 30 Days
- Last 90 Days
- Year to Date
- Custom Range

### 8.6 Forecasting

**Post-MVP Feature**

Future implementation will include:
- Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly forecasts
- Stage-based probability weighting
- Volume × Price calculations

### 8.7 Metrics NOT in MVP

- Velocity metrics (time-in-stage, cycle time)
- Principal login portal
- Weighted value forecasting
- PDF export
- Won/Lost Analysis (requires win/loss reason UI implementation first)

---

## 9. User Interface

### 9.1 Primary Navigation

**List with Filters** - Sortable/filterable table as primary opportunity view

**Filter Options:**
- Principal (Organization type)
- Stage
- Owner (rep)
- Date range
- Status (Open/Won/Lost)
- Campaign (simple text tag on opportunity - not a separate entity)

**Bulk Operations (MVP):**
- Bulk stage updates
- Bulk owner reassignment
- Bulk soft delete
- Select all / select page / individual selection

**Search:**
- Entity-specific search within each module (MVP)
- Global search across all entities (Post-MVP)

### 9.2 Dashboard

**Default View:** Principal-focused dashboard (V3)

**Key Components:**
- KPI Summary Row (4 clickable metric cards)
- Pipeline summary by principal with momentum indicators
- Stale deal warnings (per-stage thresholds with visual decay)
- Tasks panel (time-bucketed: Overdue → Today → Tomorrow)
- Quick activity logging FAB (Floating Action Button)
- Recent activity feed
- **My Performance widget (v1.9)**

#### 9.2.1 KPI Summary Row (v1.9 - CORRECTED)

Four clickable metric cards at top of dashboard. Each card navigates to a filtered list view on click.

| # | KPI | Display | Click Action | Notes |
|---|-----|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | **Open Opportunities** | Count (e.g., "23") | → Opportunities list (open only) | ⚠️ Changed from "Total Pipeline Value" - no $ amounts in MVP |
| 2 | **Overdue Tasks** | Count (RED if > 0) | → Tasks list (overdue filter) | Red destructive styling when count > 0 |
| 3 | **Activities This Week** | Count | → Activities list (this week) | Calendar week (Mon-Sun) |
| 4 | **Stale Deals** | Count (AMBER if > 0) | → Opportunities list (stale filter) | Per-stage thresholds apply |

> **CRITICAL FIX (v1.9):** The first KPI was incorrectly showing "Total Pipeline Value: $125,000" which conflicts with Decision #5 (Pricing/Volume deferred to post-MVP). Changed to "Open Opportunities" count to avoid misleading users about forecasting capabilities.

**KPI Card Interaction:**
- `role="button"` with `tabIndex={0}` for keyboard accessibility
- `aria-label` includes metric name, value, and "Click to view details"
- Hover: subtle elevation lift
- Focus: `ring-2 ring-primary` focus indicator

#### 9.2.2 Pipeline Table UI Clarity (v1.9)

**Column Definitions with Tooltips:**

| Column | Tooltip Text | Calculation |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **This Week** | "Activities logged Mon-Sun of current week" | Count of activities with `activity_date` in current calendar week |
| **Last Week** | "Activities logged Mon-Sun of previous week" | Count of activities with `activity_date` in previous calendar week |
| **Momentum** | "Based on activity trend over 14 days" | See Section 6.3 for thresholds |

**"Next Action" Column Behavior:**
- If opportunity has a scheduled task → Show task subject as text
- If no scheduled task → Show "Schedule follow-up" as **plain text** (not a link)
- ⚠️ **Do NOT** use `variant="link"` styling for non-functional elements

#### 9.2.3 Task Snooze Behavior (v1.9)

When user clicks the snooze icon (⏰) on a task:

**Interaction Flow:**
```
[Click ⏰] → Popover opens with options:
            ┌─────────────────────────┐
            │ Snooze until...         │
            ├─────────────────────────┤
            │ ○ Tomorrow              │
            │ ○ Next Week (Monday)    │
            │ ○ Custom Date... [📅]   │
            └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Business Rules:**
- "Tomorrow" = next calendar day at 9:00 AM
- "Next Week" = following Monday at 9:00 AM
- "Custom Date" opens date picker (time defaults to 9:00 AM)
- Snooze updates `due_date` field on task record
- Toast notification: "Task snoozed until [date]"

> **Rationale:** Auto-snoozing by exactly 24 hours without feedback is confusing. Users need to know when the task will reappear.

#### 9.2.4 Tasks Panel Scope (v1.9)

The Tasks panel shows **only immediate tasks** (Overdue, Today, Tomorrow). Tasks due in 3+ days do NOT appear on the dashboard.

| Time Bucket | Color | Criteria |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Overdue** | 🔴 Red (`destructive`) | `due_date < today` |
| **Today** | 🟡 Amber (`warning`) | `due_date = today` |
| **Tomorrow** | 🔵 Blue (`info`) | `due_date = tomorrow` |
| **Future** | — | Not shown on dashboard |

> **User Expectation:** Users should use the full Tasks list (`/tasks`) to see all upcoming tasks. The dashboard is for **immediate execution**, not planning.

**My Performance Widget:**

Personal performance snapshot showing current user's metrics:

| Metric | Display | Time Period |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Activities This Week | Count + trend arrow | Current week |
| Deals Moved Forward | Stage progressions | Current week |
| Tasks Completed | Count | Current week |
| Open Opportunities | Active deal count | Current |

**Design:**
- Compact card in dashboard sidebar
- Green/red trend indicators vs. previous week
- Click-through to detailed personal report

#### 9.2.5 Weekly Focus Widget (v1.11)

A dedicated text widget at the top of the dashboard where reps define their single weekly focus goal. Based on MFB's "One Thing" accountability methodology.

**Display:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 My Focus This Week                           [Edit] │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ "Close Sysco Chicago authorization for McCRUM"        │
│                                          Set: Mon 9am │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Fields:**
- `focus_text` - Free text (max 200 chars)
- `set_date` - Timestamp when focus was set
- `user_id` - Current user

**Behavior:**
- One focus per user per week (Monday-Sunday)
- Persists until user changes it or new week starts
- Previous week's focus archived (viewable in history)
- Empty state: "What's your ONE focus this week?" with CTA to set

**Implementation:**
- Simple `user_weekly_focus` table with user_id, week_start_date, focus_text
- Widget renders at top of dashboard, above KPI cards
- [Edit] button opens inline text input (no modal needed)

### 9.3 Responsive Design

| Screen Size | Support Level |
|-------------|---------------|
| Desktop (1024px+) | Primary design |
| Tablet (768-1023px) | Full functionality |
| Phone (320-767px) | **Full functionality** (required) |

**Approach:** Desktop-first design with full mobile support

**Mobile Quick Actions (v1.9):**

Field reps need fast, one-tap access to common activities. The mobile interface shows 6 optimized quick action buttons:

| Quick Action | Activity Type | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Log Check-In | `check_in` | Quick "I was here" marker |
| Log Sample Drop | `sample` | Sample delivery in field |
| Log Call | `call` | Phone conversation |
| Log Meeting/Visit | `meeting` / `site_visit` | In-person engagement |
| Quick Note | `note` | Fast text capture |
| Complete Task | Task completion | Mark tasks done on-the-go |

**Desktop-Only Activity Types (accessible via full form):**
- `email` - Typically logged at desk
- `demo` - Scheduled, not impromptu
- `proposal` - Document-heavy
- `trade_show` - Event context
- `contract_review` - Complex activity
- `social` - Less common
- `follow_up` - Can use Quick Note instead

### 9.4 Theme

**Dark Mode:** User-toggleable (support both light and dark themes)

---

## 10. Technical Requirements

### 10.1 Authentication

**Method:** Email + Password (traditional login)

**Session:** Standard web session management via Supabase Auth

**Future:** Google SSO (not MVP)

### 10.2 Connectivity

**Offline Mode:** Not supported (online required)

All operations require internet connection.

### 10.3 Audit Trail

**Full audit logging:**
- Track all field changes
- Record: who, what, when, old value, new value
- All entities audited
- View via ChangeLog tab on opportunities

### 10.4 Duplicate Prevention

**Hybrid Duplicate Detection (v1.9):**

Two-tier approach balancing data quality with user flexibility:

| Match Type | Behavior | User Action |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Exact Match** | Hard block | Must use existing opportunity |
| **Fuzzy Match** | Soft warning | Can proceed with confirmation |

**Exact Match Definition:**
- Same Principal + Same Customer + Same Product (if specified)
- Case-insensitive comparison
- **Hard block** - Cannot create duplicate

**Fuzzy Match Definition:**
- Similar customer name (Levenshtein distance ≤ 3)
- Same Principal + Different product
- **Soft warning** - Shows potential duplicates, allows creation

**Implementation:**
```
ON opportunity.create:
  IF exact_match_exists:
    BLOCK with link to existing opportunity
  ELSE IF fuzzy_match_found:
    WARN "Similar opportunity exists: [link]"
    ALLOW creation with confirmation
  ELSE:
    CREATE normally
```

## 13. Authorization Tracking

### 13.1 Dual-Level Authorization Architecture (MVP - To Implement)

Authorization tracking operates at **two levels** to support both broad distributor relationships and granular product-level control.

#### Level 1: Distributor-Principal Authorization (Organization Level)

Track which distributors are authorized to carry a principal's product line.

**Table:** `distributor_principal_authorizations` (to be created)

**Fields:**
- `distributor_id` - Organization with type='distributor'
- `principal_id` - Organization with type='principal'
- `is_authorized` - Boolean (Authorized/Not Authorized)
- `authorization_date` - When authorization was granted
- `expiration_date` - Optional expiration (nullable)
- `notes` - Free text notes
- `created_by` - User who created the record

**Use Case:** "Sysco is authorized to carry McCRUM products"

#### Level 2: Product-Distributor Authorization (Product Level)

Track product-specific exceptions to the organization-level authorization.

**Table:** `product_distributor_authorizations` (exists)

**Fields:**
- `product_id` - Specific product from products table
- `distributor_id` - Organization with type='distributor'
- `is_authorized` - Boolean override
- `authorization_date`, `notes`, `created_by`

**Use Case:** "Sysco carries McCRUM products EXCEPT for Product X (discontinued)"

#### Authorization Logic

```
IF product_distributor_authorization exists for (product, distributor):
    USE product-level authorization
ELSE:
    DERIVE from distributor_principal_authorization (via product.principal_id)
```

### 13.2 Authorization Workflow

- **View authorizations on Distributor detail page** - New "Authorizations" tab showing:
  - List of authorized principals (org-level)
  - Product-level exceptions/overrides
- **Soft warning** when creating opportunity for non-authorized combo (banner displayed, creation allowed)
- Filter opportunities by authorization status
- No manager approval required - informational warning only

### 13.3 Lost Authorization

**When a distributor loses authorization:**
- Manual cleanup by users
- No automatic cascade to opportunities
- Users manually close affected opportunities
- Product-level authorizations remain (explicit overrides preserved)

---

## 14. Rep Performance (KPIs)

### 14.1 What Defines a "Good Week"

- Number of activities logged
- Deals moved forward (stage progression)
- New opportunities created
- Tasks completed

### 14.2 Manager Visibility

- **Login tracking:** No (trust-based culture)
- **Activity counts:** Yes
- **Pipeline movement:** Yes
- **Task completion:** Yes

### 16.3 Open Questions

*No open questions - all clarified via Gemini 3 Pro + GPT 5.1 deep analysis + Claude audit + industry best practices review (Perplexity research).*

---

## 17. Risks & Mitigations

### 17.1 Adoption Risk

**Risk:** Missing key features that block daily workflows

**Mitigation:** Focus on must-haves (principal views, quick logging, exports, samples, mobile)

### 17.2 Data Quality Risk

**Risk:** Garbage in from Excel migration

**Mitigation:** Skip invalid rows, generate error report, manual cleanup queue

### 17.3 Full Commitment Risk

**Risk:** No Excel fallback means issues are critical

**Mitigation:** Thorough user testing before launch, staged rollout consideration

### 17.4 MVP Blocker Risk

**Risk:** 41 features still need implementation (updated per Opportunity Feature Matrix audit 2025-11-28)

**Mitigation:** Prioritize in order:
1. **Contact enforcement** (Critical): Enforce organization requirement - blocks orphan contacts
2. **Pipeline migration** (Critical): Migrate from 8→7 stages, update existing `awaiting_response` records
3. **Win/Loss Reasons** (Critical): MVP Blocker - required for sales analysis (industry standard)
4. **Dashboard gaps** (Quick wins): KPI fix, Recent Activity Feed, QuickLogForm 13 types, My Performance widget
5. **Stale detection** (Medium): Per-stage thresholds, visual decay indicators
6. **Contact filters** (Medium): Add organization filter to ContactListFilter
7. **Sample tracking** (Medium): Full workflow UI with status + feedback
8. **Organization features** (Medium): Bulk owner reassignment, Authorization UI tab, email field, soft duplicate warning
9. **Opportunity features** (Medium): Bulk delete, Contact-Customer Org validation
10. **Product UX** (Quick win): Add create buttons to ProductList, remove F&B fields from UI
11. **Mobile UX** (Medium): 6-button mobile quick actions
12. **Business logic** (Complex): Hybrid Duplicate Prevention, Authorization Tracking, Activity auto-cascade
13. **Notifications** (Medium): Daily email digest (Supabase Edge Function), Task follow-up prompt
14. **Cleanup** (Low): Remove DataQualityTab + unused contact_duplicates DB artifacts

## 18. Appendix

### A. Win/Loss Reason Options

**Win Reasons:**
- Relationship (existing trust)
- Product quality
- Price competitive
- Distributor preference
- Other (free text)

**Loss Reasons:**
- Price too high
- No distributor authorization
- Competitor relationship (competitor name in free-text notes)
- Product not a fit
- Timing/budget
- Other (free text)

**Competitor Tracking:** Free text only. No competitor entity in MVP. Mention competitor names in notes or "Other" loss reason field.

### B. Sample Feedback Options

- Positive
- Negative
- Pending
- No response

### C. Activity Type Reference

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Guaranteed Sale Policy** | Whether principal offers guaranteed sales | "Yes - 30-day returns accepted" |
| **Initial Program Offer** | Standard introductory programs | "Free shipping on first 3 orders" |
| **Market Segment Fit** | Target customer types | "Fine dining, upscale casual" |
| **Competitive Analysis** | Key differentiators vs competitors | "Premium quality, 20% higher price point vs Brand X" |
| **Corporate/Group Programs** | Available GPO or chain programs | "Foodbuy contracted, Premier pending" |

> **Usage:** Admin or manager pastes this information into the Principal organization's Description field during setup. Reps can reference this context when pitching to distributors and operators.

### D.1 Organization Priority Reference

**Note:** Organizations use a letter-grade priority system (A/B/C/D), distinct from Opportunity priority (Low/Medium/High/Critical). This provides quick visual triage for account prioritization.

| Priority | UI Label | Description | Color |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| `A` | A - High Priority | Top-tier accounts requiring immediate attention | Red (destructive) |
| `B` | B - Medium-High Priority | Important accounts with active engagement | Amber (warning) |
| `C` | C - Medium Priority | Standard accounts (default for new organizations) | Gray (secondary) |
| `D` | D - Low Priority | Lower priority or dormant accounts | Light gray (muted) |

**Default:** New organizations default to Priority C.

**Usage:** Priority is set per-organization and helps reps focus on high-value relationships. It does not affect opportunity stage calculations.

**Anchor Account Convention (v1.11):**

"Anchor accounts" are critical operator relationships that secure distribution slots for a principal's products. These accounts are strategically important because losing them could affect distributor authorization.

**Identification Methods:**
1. **Priority A designation** - Use Priority A for anchor accounts requiring immediate attention
2. **Tag in notes** - Add `#anchor` to the organization's notes field for searchability
3. **Description field** - Document why the account is an anchor (e.g., "Anchor for McCRUM at Sysco Chicago - 500 cases/month")

> **Note:** No dedicated "anchor" field exists. Reps use the flexible Priority + notes approach to identify strategic relationships without additional schema complexity.

### D.2 Organization Parent Hierarchy

Organizations support parent-child relationships for modeling corporate structures (franchises, regional branches, subsidiaries).

**Fields:**
- `parent_organization_id` - Reference to parent organization (nullable)

**Features:**
- **Hierarchy Breadcrumb** - Shows parent chain on organization detail page
- **Branch Locations Section** - Lists child organizations on parent's page
- **Rollup Metrics** - Parent orgs show aggregated contact/opportunity counts across branches

**Business Rules:**
- An organization can have at most one parent
- Circular references are prevented at the database level
- Deleting a parent does NOT cascade to children (children become top-level)
- Type inheritance: Children do NOT inherit parent's organization_type

**Use Cases:**
- Sysco (parent) → Sysco Denver, Sysco Chicago (branches)
- Restaurant Group (parent) → Individual restaurant locations

### D.3 Organization Segments (v1.11 - Expanded)

Organizations can be classified into business segments for filtering and reporting. Segments are aligned with MFB's strategic target categories from the Business Playbook.

**Implementation:** `segment_id` references the `segments` table.

**Segment Categories (8 types from Playbook):**

| Segment | Description | Target Count |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Major Broadline Distributor** | Large national distributors (Sysco, USF, GFS, PFG) | 27 |
| **Specialty/Regional Distributor** | Regional and specialty food distributors | 50+ |
| **Management Company** | Foodservice management companies (Aramark, Compass, Sodexo) | 12 |
| **GPO** | Group Purchasing Organizations (Foodbuy, Premier, Vizient, Entegra) | 6 |
| **University** | College and university foodservice | 13 |
| **Restaurant Group** | Multi-location restaurant operators (LEYE, Dineamic, Boka) | 18 |
| **Chain Restaurant** | National/regional chain restaurants | 45+ |
| **Hotel & Aviation** | Hotels, casinos, airline catering | — |
| **Unknown** | Uncategorized (default for new organizations) | — |

> **Migration Note:** The previous generic segments (Restaurant, Healthcare, Education, etc.) are replaced by these strategic categories. Existing organizations should be re-categorized during data migration.

**Usage:**
- Filter organization lists by segment
- Segment appears in organization detail sidebar
- Segment is included in CSV exports
- Enables strategic reporting by target category

**Permissions:** Any authenticated user can assign segments. Segment management (add/edit/delete segment types) is admin-only.

### E. Task Type Reference

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `call` | Phone call task |
| `email` | Send email task |
| `meeting` | Schedule meeting |
| `follow_up` | Follow-up action |
| `demo` | Product demo |
| `proposal` | Send proposal |
| `other` | Other task |
