## Overview

### What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT)?
User Acceptance Testing is the final validation phase where actual users verify that the migrated CRM system meets business requirements and functions correctly in real-world scenarios.

### Migration Summary
The CRM system has been migrated from a simple **Deals-based** structure to an enhanced **Opportunities-based** system with the following key changes:

| Before (Deals) | After (Opportunities) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Basic deal tracking | Enhanced opportunity management |
| Single-company contacts | Multi-organization contact relationships |
| Simple pipeline stages | Lifecycle stages with probability tracking |
| Basic categorization | Priority levels and organization types |

### UAT Objectives

- ‚úÖ Confirm new features work as designed
- ‚úÖ Ensure critical business workflows function properly
- ‚úÖ Validate user interface changes are intuitive and complete
