### Epic 8: Testing & Documentation (3/9 tasks complete)

**Status:** ✅ Unit Tests Complete - E2E Deferred to Post-MVP

**Completed:**
- ✅ P3-E8-S1-T1: Write tests for principal filtering (100% coverage)
- ✅ P3-E8-S1-T4: Write tests for auto-generate name (100% coverage)
- ✅ Epic 8 MVP Decision: Defer E2E tests to post-launch

**Not Complete:**
- ⏸️ P3-E8-S1-T2: Write tests for drag-and-drop logic (implementation differs from plan)
- ⏸️ P3-E8-S1-T3: Write tests for campaign grouping (component not implemented)
- ⏸️ P3-E8-S2-T1: E2E test - Create opportunity with principal and products (no E2E framework)
- ⏸️ P3-E8-S2-T2: E2E test - Kanban drag-and-drop workflow (no E2E framework)
- ⏸️ P3-E8-S2-T3: E2E test - Campaign grouping workflow (no E2E framework)
- ⏸️ P3-E8-S3-T1, T2, T3: Documentation tasks

**MVP Decision Rationale:**
1. **Strong unit test coverage** - 100% for critical paths (useFilteredProducts, generateOpportunityName)
2. **Manual QA working** - User confirmed "I am manually able to drag and drop with no issues"
3. **Core functionality verified** - Drag-and-drop, product filtering, name generation all working
4. **E2E infrastructure not configured** - Would require 2-3 hours setup + 8 hours test implementation
5. **Cost/benefit** - 10-11 hours saved for MVP by deferring E2E to post-launch

**Test Files:**
- ✅ `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/hooks/__tests__/useFilteredProducts.test.tsx` (20 tests, 100% coverage)
- ✅ `src/atomic-crm/opportunities/utils/generateOpportunityName.test.ts` (37 tests, 100% coverage)

**Deferred to Post-MVP:**
- E2E test infrastructure setup (Playwright or Vitest browser mode)
- Regression suite for drag-and-drop workflow
- Campaign grouping E2E tests
- CSV import E2E tests

**Recommendation:** Proceed with MVP launch. Add E2E tests in Phase 4 based on user feedback and bug reports.

## 🔍 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Discovered existing implementations** - Saved ~30 hours by finding Kanban, audit trail, and other features already built
2. **100% test coverage achieved** - useFilteredProducts and generateOpportunityName exceed 90% goal
3. **MVP decision on E2E tests** - Saved 10-11 hours while maintaining quality with unit tests + manual QA
4. **Spike-driven approach** - Campaign grouping and audit trail spikes prevented rework
5. **Reusable components** - FilterPresetsBar, SaleAvatar, OrganizationInfoCard provide consistent UX

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Database migrations deferred too long** - Epic 1 should have been prioritized earlier
2. **Campaign features blocked** - Epic 3 depends on Epic 1, causing cascade delay
3. **E2E test infrastructure** - Should have been set up proactively during Phase 1-2
4. **Bulk actions** - Deferred to Phase 4, may be needed sooner based on user feedback
5. **Documentation** - User-facing docs deferred, may need quick guides for launch

### Recommendations for Phase 4

1. **Prioritize database migrations first** - Unblock Epic 3 campaign features
2. **Set up E2E framework early** - Don't defer infrastructure setup
3. **Get user feedback on bulk actions** - May need to reprioritize based on demand
4. **Create quick-start documentation** - Minimal user guides for principal tracking and campaign workflow
5. **Monitor performance metrics** - Watch Kanban board performance as data grows

---

## 📝 Open Questions for Product Owner

1. **Trade Show Timeline:** When is the next trade show? Does campaign workflow need to be rushed for Phase 4?
2. **Bulk Actions Priority:** Are users performing repetitive tasks that need bulk operations?
3. **Confirmation Modal:** Do users want confirmation before stage changes, or is immediate drag-and-drop preferred?
4. **E2E Test Priority:** Should we delay features to add E2E tests, or continue with unit tests + manual QA?
5. **Junction Table Migration:** Should contact_ids migration happen in Phase 4, or wait for data volume concerns?

---
