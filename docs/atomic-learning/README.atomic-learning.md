# Atomic Learning Model – React + shadcn Project

This folder is my **learning map** for the project.
Instead of trying to understand everything at once, I'll study the code in layers:

- **Atoms** – small, focused components (buttons, inputs, badges)
- **Molecules** – atoms combined into small units (search bars, stat cards)
- **Organisms** – full sections (sidebars, task panels, dashboards sections)
- **Pages** – full screens composed from organisms and molecules
- **Flows** – multi-step user journeys across pages (e.g., log in → view dashboard → edit opportunity)

## How I'll Use This

- List real files from the project under each level.
- Add short notes each time I read or change a file.
- Use this as an index for learning: "What are my atoms? What are my organisms?"

## Files in This Folder

- `00-inventory-checklist.md` – quick checklist to inventory project files into atomic levels.
- `01-atoms-notes.md` – notes about small, focused components.
- `02-molecules-notes.md` – notes about combined UI pieces.
- `03-organisms-notes.md` – notes about larger sections / blocks.
- `04-pages-notes.md` – notes about full pages / routes.
- `05-flows-notes.md` – notes about user flows across multiple pages.
