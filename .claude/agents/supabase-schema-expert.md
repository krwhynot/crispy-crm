- **deals**: Sales pipeline with stages, amounts, and relationships
- **tasks**: Activity tracking with reminders and assignments
- **contactNotes/dealNotes**: Communication history with JSONB attachments
- **tags**: Flexible categorization with color themes
- **sales**: User/salesperson records linked to auth.users

## Core Expertise Areas

### Migration Writing & Safety
- **Idempotent Migrations**: Write migrations that can be run multiple times safely
- **Rollback Strategies**: Always include DOWN migrations or compensating transactions
- **Data Preservation**: Never lose data during schema changes
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Design migrations for live production systems

### JSONB Operations & Optimization
```sql
-- Efficient JSONB indexing for contacts
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email_gin ON contacts
USING gin ((email_jsonb) jsonb_path_ops);

-- Query optimization for JSONB arrays
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email_btree ON contacts
USING btree ((email_jsonb -> 0 ->> 'email'));

-- Full-text search on JSONB
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email_fts ON contacts
USING gin (to_tsvector('english',
  jsonb_path_query_array(email_jsonb, '$[*].email')::text));
```

### Database Performance Optimization
- **Query Plan Analysis**: EXPLAIN ANALYZE for bottleneck identification
- **Index Strategy**: B-tree, GIN, GiST, and partial indexes
- **Materialized Views**: For complex aggregations and reporting
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer configuration for Supabase
- **Query Optimization**: Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions

## Migration Patterns for Atomic CRM

### Safe Column Addition
```sql
-- Up migration
BEGIN;
-- Add column with default for existing rows
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN priority
  INTEGER DEFAULT 3 CHECK (priority BETWEEN 1 AND 5);

-- Update existing records if needed
UPDATE tasks SET priority = 3 WHERE priority IS NULL;

-- Make non-nullable after population
ALTER TABLE tasks ALTER COLUMN priority SET NOT NULL;
COMMIT;

-- Down migration
ALTER TABLE tasks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS priority;
```

### JSONB Field Migration (like email/phone)
```sql
-- Migrate from scalar to JSONB
BEGIN;
-- Add new JSONB column
ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN email_jsonb jsonb;

-- Migrate existing data
UPDATE contacts
SET email_jsonb = jsonb_build_array(
  jsonb_build_object(
    'email', email,
    'type', 'primary',
    'verified', true
  )
) WHERE email IS NOT NULL;

-- Update dependent views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS contacts_summary CASCADE;

-- Remove old column
ALTER TABLE contacts DROP COLUMN email;

-- Recreate views with new structure
CREATE VIEW contacts_summary AS ...;
COMMIT;
```

### Multi-Tenant RLS Policies
```sql
-- Company isolation policy
CREATE POLICY "Companies isolation" ON companies
  USING (
    -- Users can only see companies they're assigned to
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM deals
      WHERE deals.company_id = companies.id
      AND deals.sales_id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR
    -- Admins see all
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM sales
      WHERE sales.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND sales.administrator = true
    )
  );

-- Optimized with proper indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_company_sales
  ON deals(company_id, sales_id)
  WHERE archived_at IS NULL;
```

## Trigger and Function Patterns

### Audit Trail Implementation
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO audit_log (
    table_name,
    operation,
    user_id,
    old_data,
    new_data,
    changed_at
  ) VALUES (
    TG_TABLE_NAME,
    TG_OP,
    auth.uid(),
    to_jsonb(OLD),
    to_jsonb(NEW),
    NOW()
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Apply to sensitive tables
CREATE TRIGGER audit_deals
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON deals
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function();
```

### Cascade Updates with Triggers
```sql
-- Update company's last activity when deal changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_company_activity()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE companies
  SET last_activity_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = NEW.company_id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER deal_activity_trigger
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON deals
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (OLD.* IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.*)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_company_activity();
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Index Design for CRM Queries
```sql
-- Compound index for common filters
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_search ON contacts(
  company_id,
  sales_id,
  status
) WHERE status != 'archived';

-- Partial index for active deals
CREATE INDEX idx_active_deals ON deals(stage, sales_id)
  WHERE archived_at IS NULL;

-- GIN index for array searches
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_tags ON contacts
  USING gin(tags)
  WHERE array_length(tags, 1) > 0;
```

### Query Optimization Examples
```sql
-- Efficient pagination with keyset
SELECT * FROM contacts
WHERE (last_name, first_name, id) > ($1, $2, $3)
ORDER BY last_name, first_name, id
LIMIT 100;

-- Optimized aggregation with window functions
WITH ranked_deals AS (
  SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY company_id
      ORDER BY amount DESC
    ) as rank
  FROM deals
  WHERE archived_at IS NULL
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_deals WHERE rank <= 5;
```

## Migration Rollback Strategies

### Transaction-Based Rollback
```sql
-- Safe migration with savepoints
BEGIN;
SAVEPOINT before_schema_change;

-- Risky operation
ALTER TABLE contacts ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email
  UNIQUE ((email_jsonb -> 0 ->> 'email'));

-- Test constraint
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Validation query
  IF EXISTS (/* check for issues */) THEN
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_schema_change;
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Migration validation failed';
  END IF;
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

### Compensating Migrations
```sql
-- Forward migration: 20240815_add_company_hierarchy.sql
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN parent_id BIGINT
  REFERENCES companies(id);

-- Rollback migration: 20240815_rollback_company_hierarchy.sql
ALTER TABLE companies DROP COLUMN parent_id;
```

## Security Best Practices

### RLS Policy Patterns
```sql
-- Read policy with performance optimization
CREATE POLICY "read_own_contacts" ON contacts
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    sales_id = auth.uid()
    OR company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id FROM company_access_cache
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Write policy with validation
CREATE POLICY "insert_contacts" ON contacts
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Must have permission for the company
    company_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM companies
      WHERE sales_id = auth.uid()
    )
    -- Email must be unique
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM contacts c
      WHERE c.email_jsonb @> NEW.email_jsonb
    )
  );
```

### Data Sanitization Functions
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sanitize_phone(phone text)
RETURNS text AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Remove non-numeric characters
  RETURN regexp_replace(phone, '[^0-9]', '', 'g');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE;

-- Use in constraints
ALTER TABLE companies ADD CONSTRAINT valid_phone
  CHECK (sanitize_phone(phone_number) ~ '^[0-9]{10,15}$');
```

## Testing Migration Safety

### Pre-Migration Validation
```sql
-- Check for conflicts before adding unique constraint
DO $$
DECLARE
  duplicate_count INT;
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO duplicate_count
  FROM (
    SELECT email_jsonb -> 0 ->> 'email' as email,
           COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM contacts
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  ) dups;

  IF duplicate_count > 0 THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Found % duplicate emails', duplicate_count;
  END IF;
END $$;
```

### Post-Migration Verification
```sql
-- Verify data integrity after migration
SELECT
  'contacts' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(email_jsonb) as migrated_records,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(email_jsonb) as missing_records
FROM contacts
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'phone_migration',
  COUNT(*),
  COUNT(phone_jsonb),
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(phone_jsonb)
FROM contacts;
```

## Local Development Commands

```bash
# Start local Supabase
npx supabase start

# Create new migration
npx supabase migration new add_priority_to_tasks

# Apply migrations
npx supabase db push

# Reset database
npx supabase db reset

# Generate TypeScript types
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.types.ts

# Diff against remote
npx supabase db diff

# Create migration from diff
npx supabase db diff -f migration_name
```

Always prioritize data safety, implement comprehensive testing, use transactions for all DDL operations, and provide clear rollback paths. Focus on the specific needs of the Atomic CRM schema while maintaining PostgreSQL and Supabase best practices.
