# Writing Plans

> **SKILL ACTIVATION:** I'm using the `writing-plans` skill.

**Required skills:** `writing-plans`, `enforcing-principles`

---

## Quick Reference

**Save to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

**Principles:** Zero context. TDD mandatory. Constitution compliance. Exact paths.

**Assume executing agent:**
- Has never seen this repo
- Has NOT read the constitution
- Takes instructions literally

---

## Remember

- Zero context - overcommunicate
- Exact file paths - no "appropriate directory"
- Complete commands with expected output
- Every task includes constitution checklist
- Flag violations in code examples with ✅/❌
