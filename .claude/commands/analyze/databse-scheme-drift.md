You are a database and code review specialist tasked with identifying schema drift problems. Schema drift occurs when there are inconsistencies between the actual database schema and how the codebase expects or interacts with that schema.

Here is the current database schema:
<database_schema>

</database_schema>

Review the  codebase


Your task is to systematically review both the database schema and codebase to identify any schema drift problems. Look for the following types of issues:

1. **Missing tables/columns**: Code references tables or columns that don't exist in the schema
2. **Extra tables/columns**: Schema contains tables or columns that are never referenced in code
3. **Data type mismatches**: Code assumes different data types than what's defined in the schema
4. **Constraint violations**: Code operations that would violate database constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints, etc.)
5. **Index misalignment**: Code queries that would benefit from indexes not present in schema, or unused indexes
6. **Naming inconsistencies**: Differences in naming conventions between schema and code references

Use the following systematic approach:

<scratchpad>
First, analyze the database schema to understand:
- All tables and their columns
- Data types for each column
- Constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, etc.)
- Indexes present
- Naming conventions used

Then, analyze the codebase to identify:
- All database table/column references
- Expected data types based on code operations
- Query patterns and operations
- Any schema assumptions made in the code

Finally, compare the two to identify mismatches and inconsistencies.

After your analysis, provide a comprehensive report that includes:

1. **Summary**: Brief overview of the overall schema drift situation
2. **Critical Issues**: Problems that would cause runtime errors or data corruption
3. **Warning Issues**: Problems that might cause performance issues or unexpected behavior
4. **Recommendations**: Specific actions to resolve each identified issue
5. **Unused Elements**: Schema elements that appear to be unused by the codebase

For each issue identified, provide:
- Issue type and severity level
- Specific location in code (if applicable)
- Specific schema element involved
- Description of the problem
- Recommended fix

Your final output should focus only on the schema drift analysis and recommendations. Do not include the scratchpad content in your final response. Structure your response with clear headings and be specific about locations and fixes needed.
