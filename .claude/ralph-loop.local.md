Open docs/TODOs/ui-ux-consistency-audit.md and complete the entire UI/UX consistency audit checklist for this project. 
Tasks:
- Review current UI components, pages, and flows.
- Identify all inconsistencies in typography, spacing, color, buttons, inputs, and navigation.
- Document issues directly in docs/TODOs/ui-ux-consistency-audit.md with clear sections, severity, and suggested fixes.
- Where safe and obvious, update the codebase to fix issues and reference commits in the doc.
- Re-scan the repo to confirm the documented issues are either fixed or explicitly deferred.
Output <promise>UI_UX_AUDIT_COMPLETE</promise> only when the audit doc is fully filled out and all checks are done.
