Read T/home/krwhynot/projects/crispy-crm/docs/TODOs/TODO_PROVIDER.md. Focus ONLY on 'Phase 1: Fix & Stabilize'. Execute the tasks in this phase: 1) Patch unifiedDataProvider.ts with the error handling code (you can find the code in the 'Previous Context' or infer it from the Zod-to-React-Admin pattern). 2) Verify the fix if possible. 3) Mark the tasks as [x] in the markdown file when done. Output <promise>PHASE_1_COMPLETE</promise> when all Phase 1 tasks are checked.
