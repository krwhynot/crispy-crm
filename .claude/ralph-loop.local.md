Read 'TODO_PROVIDER.md'1. **Verify Deletion**: Confirm 'src/atomic-crm/providers/supabase/unifiedDataProvider.ts' does not exist.
2. **Close Phase 4**: Mark the deferred 'Cleanup' tasks in Phase 4 as [x] (since the file is gone).
3. **Documentation**: Update 'src/atomic-crm/providers/supabase/README.md' to describe the new Handlers + Services architecture (Golden Rules, Wrapper Pattern).
4. **Final Status**: Mark the 'Manual smoke test' as [x] ONLY if you can verify the 'Opportunities' handler file exists and has the correct service calls (static verification), OR add a note that it requires manual QA.

Output <promise>PROJECT_CLOSED</promise> when the Todo file is clean and README is updated.
