-- Remove Backward Compatibility - Phase 2
-- Date: 2025-09-26
-- Description: Remove all backward compatibility fields and triggers
--              from the database schema to enforce pure junction table
--              relationships and clean opportunities-based patterns.
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- DROP TRIGGERS AND FUNCTIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the trigger that maintains backward compatibility
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS maintain_primary_organization ON contact_organizations;

-- Drop the function that syncs primary organization to contacts.company_id
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS sync_primary_organization();

-- =====================================================
-- DROP LEGACY COLUMNS
-- =====================================================

-- Drop company_id from contacts table (replaced by junction table)
ALTER TABLE contacts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS company_id;

-- Drop is_primary_contact from contact_organizations table (redundant with is_primary)
ALTER TABLE contact_organizations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_primary_contact;

-- Drop archived_at from tasks table (replaced by deleted_at pattern)
ALTER TABLE tasks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS archived_at;

-- =====================================================
-- DROP LEGACY INDEXES
-- =====================================================

-- Drop indexes that reference removed columns
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_contacts_company_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_opportunities_company_id;

-- =====================================================
-- UPDATE VIEWS
-- =====================================================

-- Update organizations_summary view to remove legacy references
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW organizations_summary AS
SELECT
    c.*,
    COUNT(DISTINCT co.contact_id) AS contact_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) AS opportunity_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) FILTER (WHERE o.stage = 'closed_won') AS won_opportunities,
    SUM(o.amount) FILTER (WHERE o.stage = 'closed_won') AS total_revenue
FROM organizations c
LEFT JOIN contact_organizations co ON c.id = co.organization_id AND co.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN opportunities o ON c.id = o.customer_organization_id AND o.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY c.id;

-- Update contacts_summary view to remove company_id references
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW contacts_summary AS
SELECT
    c.*,
    (SELECT comp.name
     FROM contact_organizations co
     JOIN organizations comp ON co.organization_id = comp.id
     WHERE co.contact_id = c.id
       AND co.is_primary = true
       AND co.deleted_at IS NULL
     LIMIT 1) AS company_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) FILTER (WHERE t.completed = false) AS open_tasks,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cn.id) AS note_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT co.organization_id) AS organization_count
FROM contacts c
LEFT JOIN tasks t ON c.id = t.contact_id AND t.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN "contactNotes" cn ON c.id = cn.contact_id
LEFT JOIN contact_organizations co ON c.id = co.contact_id AND co.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY c.id;

-- =====================================================
-- CLEANUP LEGACY REFERENCES
-- =====================================================

-- Remove any remaining references to archived_at in function calls
-- (This is a no-op if no such references exist, but ensures completeness)

-- Update any indexes that might still reference the old pattern
-- All junction table operations now use deleted_at consistently

-- =====================================================
-- VALIDATION
-- =====================================================

-- Ensure all contact-organization relationships go through junction table
-- This query should return 0 rows after migration
-- SELECT 'Validation check: All contacts should have organization relationships via junction table' AS check_description,
--        COUNT(*) AS orphaned_contacts
-- FROM contacts c
-- LEFT JOIN contact_organizations co ON c.id = co.contact_id AND co.deleted_at IS NULL
-- WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL AND co.id IS NULL;

-- Note: Uncomment the validation query above if you want to run it manually
-- to verify that all contacts have proper junction table relationships.
