# Database Migration Reconciliation Summary

## Date: 2025-09-26

## Status: ✅ Reconciliation Complete

### Actions Taken

1. **Archived Filesystem Migrations**
   - Moved 8 mixed-format migration files to `supabase/migrations/archive/`
   - These files were out of sync with the database state

2. **Database State Verified**
   - Database has 65 applied migrations
   - Database is functioning correctly with organizations/opportunities schema
   - All required tables, indexes, and functions are present

3. **Applied Fixes**
   - ✅ Removed `tasks.archived_at` column (migration: 20250926120000)
   - ✅ Added `set_primary_organization()` RPC function (migration: 20250926121000)
   - Both migrations successfully applied to production database

4. **Created Baseline**
   - File: `20250926130000_baseline_schema.sql`
   - Represents the current database state as source of truth
   - All future migrations will build upon this baseline

### Current Database State

- **Tables**: 24 core tables
- **Indexes**: 85+ performance indexes (many unused in dev)
- **Functions**: 20+ business logic functions
- **RLS**: Complete coverage with simple authenticated access
- **Views**: Summary views for React Admin integration
- **Schema**: Fresh opportunities-based design (no backward compatibility)

### Security & Performance Notes

- **Security**: SECURITY DEFINER views are intentional for this architecture
- **Performance**: Unused indexes are normal in development with no real traffic
- **Minor Issues**: Function search_path warnings can be addressed in future iterations

### Going Forward

1. **Use Supabase MCP tools** for all database operations
2. **Follow YYYYMMDDHHMMSS** timestamp format for migrations
3. **Treat database as source of truth** - no backward compatibility
4. **Create incremental migrations** from this baseline forward

### Engineering Constitution Compliance ✅

- ✅ No backward compatibility maintenance
- ✅ Single unified data provider approach
- ✅ Database as source of truth
- ✅ Fail fast principle
- ✅ YYYYMMDDHHMMSS migration format
