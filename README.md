## Migration Notes (v0.2.0)

### Deal to Opportunity Migration
The CRM has been enhanced to support more sophisticated sales processes. Key changes include:

- **Renamed Entities**: `deals` are now `opportunities` throughout the system
- **Environment Variables**: All `DEAL_*` variables renamed to `OPPORTUNITY_*`
- **Enhanced Schema**: Opportunities now support multiple participants, activity tracking, and interaction history
- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Contacts can belong to multiple organizations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy deal endpoints remain functional during transition

### Development Tooling Updates
New development scripts for working with the enhanced schema:

```sh
# Generate seed data for development
npm run seed:data                # Insert test data
npm run seed:data:dry-run        # Preview without inserting
npm run seed:data:clean          # Clean and regenerate

# Database migration tools
npm run migrate:production        # Execute production migration
npm run migrate:dry-run          # Preview migration changes
npm run migrate:backup           # Backup before migration
npm run migrate:rollback         # Rollback if needed
npm run migrate:validate         # Validate migration success

# Cache and search management
npm run cache:clear              # Clear application caches
npm run search:reindex           # Reindex search data
```

Test fixtures have been updated to use the new opportunity schema structure. See `/tests/fixtures/` for examples.
