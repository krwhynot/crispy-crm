/**
 * Organizations Resource Lifecycle Callbacks
 *
 * Resource-specific logic for organizations using React Admin's withLifecycleCallbacks pattern.
 * Uses the createResourceCallbacks factory for standard soft-delete behavior.
 *
 * Key behaviors:
 * 1. Soft delete - Sets deleted_at instead of hard delete
 * 2. Filter cleaning - Adds soft delete filter by default
 * 3. Data transformation - Strips computed fields before save
 * 4. Logo handling - Preserved by storage service
 *
 * Engineering Constitution: Resource-specific logic extracted for single responsibility
