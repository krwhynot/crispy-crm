## 1. Dependency Analysis

### 1.1 Dependency Graph Overview

**Total Dependencies:** 702
- Production: 271
- Development: 361
- Optional: 81
- Peer: 17

### 1.2 Critical Production Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose | Security Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| `@supabase/supabase-js` | ^2.39.0 | Backend connectivity | Secure, well-maintained |
| `react` | ^19.1.0 | UI framework | Latest stable version |
| `react-router-dom` | ^6.30.1 | Routing | Up-to-date |
| `zod` | ^4.0.5 | Schema validation | Underutilized - should be expanded |
| `@tanstack/react-query` | ^5.85.9 | Data fetching | Modern, secure patterns |
| `lodash` | ^4.17.21 | Utilities | Known prototype pollution fixed in this version |

### 1.3 Security-Critical Dependencies

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- `ra-supabase-core` (^3.5.1) - Provides auth integration
- Supabase Auth handles OAuth, password management

**Data Sanitization:**
- `DOMPurify` - Implemented for XSS prevention ✅
- Custom sanitization module at `/src/lib/sanitization.ts`

### 1.4 Circular Dependencies

**Detected Issues:**
```
1. src/atomic-crm/root/CRM.tsx -> self-reference
2. src/components/admin/file-field.tsx -> self-reference
```

**Risk Level:** LOW - These are self-referential imports, not true circular dependencies between modules.

### 1.5 Module Coupling Analysis

| Module | Coupling Ratio | External Dependencies | Risk Assessment |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| atomic-crm | 37.1% | components, hooks, lib | Moderate coupling - acceptable |
| components | 34.9% | lib, hooks, atomic-crm | Some back-dependency to atomic-crm |
| lib | 0% | None | Well isolated ✅ |
| hooks | 0% | None | Well isolated ✅ |

## 2. Security Architecture Review

### 2.1 Authentication Flow

**Implementation:** `/src/atomic-crm/providers/supabase/authProvider.ts`

**Strengths:**
- Leverages Supabase Auth for secure authentication
- Session management handled by Supabase
- Role-based access control implemented (admin/user)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Cache invalidation on login but cached sale data persists in memory
- ⚠️ No rate limiting at application level (relies on Supabase)
- ⚠️ Missing multi-factor authentication configuration

### 2.2 Authorization & Data Access

**RLS (Row Level Security) Analysis:**

```sql
-- Example from tags_policy.sql
create policy "Enable delete for authenticated users only"
on "public"."tags"
using (true); -- ⚠️ OVERLY PERMISSIVE
```

**Critical Finding:** Several RLS policies use `using (true)` which allows ANY authenticated user to perform operations. This violates the principle of least privilege.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper RLS policies that check user ownership or organization membership:
```sql
-- Improved example
create policy "Enable delete for owned tags only"
on "public"."tags"
using (auth.uid() = user_id OR is_admin());
```

### 2.3 Input Validation & Sanitization

**Current State:**
- ✅ DOMPurify implementation for HTML sanitization
- ✅ Comprehensive sanitization utilities in `/src/lib/sanitization.ts`
- ⚠️ Zod installed but not actively used for API validation
- ⚠️ No consistent validation at data provider boundary

**Sanitization Coverage:**
```typescript
// Good implementation found
- sanitizeHtml() - General HTML content
- sanitizeEmailHtml() - Email templates
- sanitizeToPlainText() - Strip all tags
- sanitizeBasicHtml() - Basic formatting only
```

### 2.4 CORS Configuration

**Location:** `/supabase/functions/_shared/cors-config.ts`

**Improvements Made:**
- ✅ Replaced wildcard (*) with allowlist
- ✅ Environment-specific origin validation
- ✅ Proper credential handling

**Configuration:**
```typescript
DEFAULT_DEVELOPMENT_ORIGINS = [
  "http://localhost:5173",
  "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
  "http://localhost:3000",
  "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
];
```

**Recommendation:** Add production domains via environment variables.

### 2.5 Security Monitoring

**Excellent Implementation:** `/src/lib/monitoring/security.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Authentication failure tracking
- ✅ CSP violation monitoring
- ✅ SQL injection pattern detection
- ✅ XSS pattern detection
- ✅ Rate limiting detection
- ✅ Suspicious pattern identification
- ✅ Security metrics dashboard

**Monitored Patterns:**
```typescript
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual user agents (bots, scrapers)
- Rapid request patterns
- Token reuse attempts
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
```

---

## 3. Environment Variable Security

**Current Configuration:**
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
VITE_INBOUND_EMAIL=your_inbound_email@example.com
```

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Using VITE_ prefix for client-side variables (correct)
- ✅ Service role keys not exposed to client
- ⚠️ No secret rotation mechanism documented
- ⚠️ No environment variable validation on startup

---

## 4. Trust Boundaries & Data Flow

### 4.1 Trust Boundaries Identified

1. **Client ↔ Supabase Edge (Primary Boundary)**
   - Authentication via Supabase Auth
   - Data access via RLS policies
   - File uploads to storage buckets

2. **Edge Functions ↔ External Services**
   - Postmark email integration
   - CORS-protected endpoints

3. **Admin ↔ User Boundaries**
   - Role-based access control
   - Admin-only operations

### 4.2 Data Validation Points

**Current Validation Layers:**
1. Client-side form validation (React Hook Form)
2. Supabase RLS policies (database level)
3. Missing: API boundary validation with Zod

---

## 5. Package Security Analysis

### 5.1 High-Risk Dependencies

**None Detected** - npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities

### 5.2 Outdated Packages Requiring Attention

| Package | Current | Latest | Risk |
|---------|---------|--------|------|
| faker | 5.5.3 | Deprecated | Replace with @faker-js/faker |

### 5.3 Development Dependencies Security

- ✅ ESLint configured for security checks
- ✅ TypeScript providing type safety
- ✅ Vitest for testing security features

---

## 6. Recommendations

---

## 7. Security Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Add security-specific test cases
- Test sanitization functions with malicious input
- Verify RLS policies with different user roles
- Test rate limiting thresholds
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test authentication flows
- OAuth login/logout
- Password reset flow
- Session management
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
npm audit
npm audit fix
# Consider adding: Snyk, OWASP dependency check
```

---

## 8. Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- ✅ Personal data sanitization in logs
- ✅ Email hashing for privacy
- ⚠️ Consider GDPR compliance for EU users
- ⚠️ Add data retention policies

### Security Standards
- Follows OWASP Top 10 mitigation strategies
- Implements defense-in-depth approach
- Consider SOC2 compliance requirements

---

## Conclusion

The Atomic CRM codebase demonstrates good security practices with comprehensive monitoring, sanitization, and modern authentication. The main areas requiring attention are:

1. **RLS policies need strengthening** - Current policies are too permissive
2. **Input validation needs implementation** - Zod is available but underutilized
3. **Some dependencies need updating** - Minor updates required

The application's security posture is solid but can be enhanced by addressing the recommendations above, particularly the critical items around RLS policies and input validation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and update RLS policies
2. Implement Zod validation schemas
3. Set up security scanning in CI/CD
4. Document security procedures
