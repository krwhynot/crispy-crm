-- Migration: Add server-side contact validation for activities
-- Purpose: Enhance activity consistency validation to enforce that contacts
--          belong to the opportunity's customer organization (security fix for API)
-- P1 Priority: Prevents malicious users from creating invalid contact-opportunity relationships
-- Author: Claude Code

-- Drop the existing trigger and function
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS validate_activity_consistency_trigger ON activities;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS validate_activity_consistency();

-- Recreate the function with enhanced contact validation

For interaction activities with both contact_id and opportunity_id:
- Verifies contact belongs to the opportunity customer organization
- Raises exception if validation fails (prevents API manipulation)
- Auto-sets organization_id from opportunity customer if not provided
Marks the founding interaction when a new opportunity interaction is created.';
